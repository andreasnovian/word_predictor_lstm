i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday december and i would like once again to wish you a happy new year in the hope that you enjoyed a pleasant festive period 
you have requested a debate on this subject in the course of the next few days during this part-session 
madam president on a point of order 
you will be aware from the press and television that there have been a number of bomb explosions and killings in sri lanka 
one of the people assassinated very recently in sri lanka was mr kumar ponnambalam who had visited the european parliament just a few months ago 
would it be appropriate for you madam president to write a letter to the sri lankan president expressing parliament's regret at his and the other violent deaths in sri lanka and urging her to do everything she possibly can to seek a peaceful reconciliation to a very difficult situation 
yes mr evans i feel an initiative of the type you have just suggested would be entirely appropriate 
if the house agrees i shall do as mr evans has suggested 
madam president on a point of order 
i would like your advice about rule concerning inadmissibility 
my question relates to something that will come up on thursday and which i will then raise again 
the cunha report on multiannual guidance programmes comes before parliament on thursday and contains a proposal in paragraph that a form of quota penalties should be introduced for countries which fail to meet their fleet reduction targets annually 
it says that this should be done despite the principle of relative stability 
i believe that the principle of relative stability is a fundamental legal principle of the common fisheries policy and a proposal to subvert it would be legally inadmissible 
i want to know whether one can raise an objection of that kind to what is merely a report not a legislative proposal and whether that is something i can competently do on thursday 
that is precisely the time when you may if you wish raise this question i.e on thursday prior to the start of the presentation of the report 
we shall call him mr hicks 
at the request of a french member mr zimeray a petition has already been presented which many people signed including myself 
however i would ask you in accordance with the line which is now constantly followed by the european parliament and by the whole of the european community to make representations using the weight of your prestigious office and the institution you represent to the president and to the governor of texas mr bush who has the power to order a stay of execution and to reprieve the condemned person 
this is all in accordance with the principles that we have always upheld 
thank you mr segni i shall do so gladly 
indeed it is quite in keeping with the positions this house has always adopted 
madam president i should like to draw your attention to a case in which this parliament has consistently shown an interest 
it is the case of alexander nikitin 
all of us here are pleased that the courts have acquitted him and made it clear that in russia too access to environmental information is a constitutional right 
now however he is to go before the courts once more because the public prosecutor is appealing 
we know and we have stated as much in very many resolutions indeed including specifically during the last plenary part-session of last year that this is not solely a legal case and that it is wrong for alexander nikitin to be accused of criminal activity and treason because of our involvement as the beneficiaries of his findings 
these findings form the basis of the european programmes to protect the barents sea and that is why i would ask you to examine a draft letter setting out the most important facts and to make parliament's position as expressed in the resolutions which it has adopted clear as far as russia is concerned 
yes mrs schroedter i shall be pleased to look into the facts of this case when i have received your letter 
madam president i would firstly like to compliment you on the fact that you have kept your word and that during this first part-session of the new year the number of television channels in our offices has indeed increased considerably 
but madam president my personal request has not been met 
although there are now two finnish channels and one portuguese one there is still no dutch channel which is what i had requested because dutch people here like to be able to follow the news too when we are sent to this place of exile every month 
i would therefore once more ask you to ensure that we get a dutch channel as well 
mrs plooij-van gorsel i can tell you that this matter is on the agenda for the quaestors' meeting on wednesday 
it will i hope be examined in a positive light 
madam president can you tell me why this parliament does not adhere to the health and safety legislation that it actually passes 
why has no air quality test been done on this particular building since we were elected 
why has there been no health and safety committee meeting since 
why has there been no fire drill either in the brussels parliament buildings or the strasbourg parliament buildings 
why are there no fire instructions 
why have the staircases not been improved since my accident 
why are no-smoking areas not enforced 
it seems absolutely disgraceful that we pass legislation and do not adhere to it ourselves 
mrs lynne you are quite right and i shall check whether this has actually not been done 
i shall also refer the matter to the college of quaestors and i am certain that they will be keen to ensure that we comply with the regulations we ourselves vote on 
madam president mrs díez gonzález and i had tabled questions on certain opinions of the vice-president mrs de palacio which appeared in a spanish newspaper 
the competent services have not included them in the agenda on the grounds that they had been answered in a previous part-session 
i would ask that they reconsider since this is not the case 
mr berenguer fuster we shall check all this 
i admit that at present the matter seems to be somewhat confused 
we shall therefore look into it properly to ensure that everything is as it should be 
madam president i should like to know if there will be a clear message going out from parliament this week about our discontent over today's decision refusing to renew the arms embargo on indonesia considering that the vast majority in this parliament have endorsed the arms embargo in indonesia in the past 
today's decision not to renew the embargo is extremely dangerous considering the situation there 
so parliament should send a message since that is the wish of the vast majority 
it is irresponsible of eu member states to refuse to renew the embargo 
as people have said the situation there is extremely volatile 
there is in fact a risk of a military coup in the future 
we do not know what is happening 
so why should eu arms producers profit at the expense of innocent people 
in any event this question is not presently included among the requests for topical and urgent debate on thursday 
the next item is the verification of the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents at its meeting of january pursuant to rule of the rules of procedure 
no amendments have been proposed relating to monday and tuesday 
the group of the party of european socialists requests that a commission statement be included on its strategic objectives for the next five years and on the administrative reform of the commission 
i would like mr barón crespo who made the request to speak to propose it 
that is if he so wishes of course 
then we shall follow the usual procedure hearing one speaker in favour and one against 
i would also like to point out madam president that this parliament voted to express its confidence in president prodi during the previous legislature 
it did so again during this legislature in july and then in september it voted once more to approve the whole commission 
there has therefore been enough time for the commission to prepare its programme and for us to become familiar with it and explain it to our citizens 
to this end i would like to remind you of the resolution of september which recommended that the proposal be presented as soon as possible 
the events of last week which originated outside the conference of presidents that conference being used simply to corroborate and ratify decisions taken elsewhere present us with a dilemma 
either the commission is not ready to present this programme in which case it should clarify it 
according to its president it is in a position to do so 
given that the commission is represented by vice-president de palacio i believe that before voting it would help if the commission could let us know how ready it is to present this programme as agreed 
alternatively parliament is not ready to examine this programme as some appear to be suggesting 
my group believes that since a parliament is meant to listen debate and reflect there can be no justification whatsoever for this delay and we believe that if the commission is ready to do so we still have time to re-establish the original agreement between parliament and the commission and proceed in a manner which fulfils our duty to our fellow citizens 
therefore the proposal of the group of the party of european socialists and which you have mentioned is that the prodi commission present its legislative programme on wednesday including its proposed administrative reform because otherwise we could find ourselves in a paradoxical situation on the pretext that there is no text on the one hand the president of the commission would be denied his right to speak in this parliament and on the other hand there would be a debate on a reform when parliament had no prior knowledge of the texts on which it is based 
therefore madam president i would ask you to request that the commission express its opinion on this issue and that we then proceed to the vote 
mr barón crespo you were unable to attend the conference of presidents last thursday 
i am not criticising this it happens from time to time that people send someone to represent them 
mr hänsch represented you on this occasion 
in the conference of presidents we had an in-depth discussion 
your group was alone in advocating what you are saying now 
we then put it to a vote 
as you know each chairman has the same number of votes as his group has members 
there was a vote on this matter 
as i recall the outcome of this vote was votes to with a few abstentions 
this means that all the groups with the exception of the non-attached members but of course they are not a group were in agreement only your group thought that we should proceed as you have proposed here 
all of the others were of a different opinion 
that was the decision 
i should now like to comment on the issue itself 
we have confidence in the commission and in romano prodi and after a difficult procedure as everyone knows the vast majority of our group supported the vote of confidence in romano prodi and the commission 
we believe however that the commission's strategic plan needs to be debated within a proper procedural framework not only on the basis of an oral statement here in the european parliament but also on the basis of a document which is adopted in the commission and which describes this programme over the five-year period 
there is no such document 
the commission will present its programme for the year in february 
we have said very well if the commission does not wish to introduce the programme as early as january then we will do it in february 
we have agreed to this 
after all we do not wish to quarrel with the commission if at all possible we believe that the commission and parliament need to tread the same path 
however we in parliament also have a supervisory role with regard to the commission and we do not have to agree with everything which comes out of the commission 
i should like us to be able to do a reasonable amount of preparation for the debate on the five-year programme in our groups 
you cannot prepare if you hear a statement in this house and have no idea of its content 
that is why we would recommend and it is my impression that the commission is also open to this idea that we hold the debate on the commission's long-term programme up to the year in february and i hope that the commission will agree on a programme before then which it will propose to us and that at the same time in february we also hold the debate on the commission's legislative programme for the year 
the fact that the subjects are connected also suggests that we should hold the debate on both programmes together 
that is why my group firmly rejects the proposal made by the socialist group 
madam president i would like to make it very clear that above all the commission has absolute respect for the decisions of this parliament and amongst those the decision establishing its agenda 
we therefore respect whatever parliament may decide 
i would also like to say that the commission is prepared and ready to hold this debate whenever it is convenient and that we were ready to do so this week as we had agreed originally on the basis that it would be presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups 
therefore madam president i would like to repeat that the commission has debated the action plan for the next five years and when parliament decides this week if that is the decision we are prepared to come and explain the programme for the next five years and next month the programme for which is what we fully agreed upon 
i propose that we vote on the request of the group of the party of european socialists that the commission statement on its strategic objectives should be reinstated 
the ppe-de group is requesting that this item be taken off the agenda 
is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of this group to propose this 
madam president i can hear a ripple of laughter from the socialists 
i was told that large sections of the socialist group were also keen to have this item taken off the agenda because at the vote in the conference of presidents no vote was received from the working group of members of the socialist group responsible for this matter 
i do not know whether this information is correct but the ppe-de group would in any case be grateful if this item were removed because parliament has addressed this issue several times already 
decisions have also been adopted against a tax of this kind 
that is why my group moves that this item be taken off the agenda 
thank you mr poettering 
we shall now hear mr wurtz speaking against this request 
he has just been preaching to the group of the party of european socialists because they went back on a decision taken in a perfectly clear manner at the conference of presidents and now he is doing just the same 
we discussed that matter and we were unanimous with the exception of the ppe and eldr groups 
as my fellow chairmen will recall i even mentioned that it was not a matter of knowing whether one was for or against the tobin tax but of whether one dared to hear what the commission and the council thought of it 
it is not a lot to ask 
i therefore repeat the proposal that this oral question to the commission and the council should be retained so that we can find out once and for all the positions of these two bodies regarding the proposal which is relatively modest but which would give a clear message to public opinion particularly after the tide of feeling generated by the failure of the seattle conference 
madam president i would like to thank mr poettering for advertising this debate 
thank you very much 
madam president has my vote been counted 
i was unable to vote electronically since i do not have a card 
my vote was in favour 
indeed if we add the two members who have declared themselves then the result of the vote would be 
madam president the presidency has already declared the result of the vote 
there is no room for amendments 
ladies and gentlemen once again we see it is essential for members to bring their voting cards along on a monday 
clearly there is a problem here 
that being the case i shall have to make a decision 
i too forgot my card and i would have voted against 
i therefore consider that the oral question may be kept on the agenda as per the vote 
this is the last time that we shall make allowances for members who have forgotten their cards 
let that be clearly noted and understood 
we shall continue with the other amendments to the agenda 
madam president in the earlier vote and i will abide by your ruling on this matter on the question of the strategic plan of the commission i indicated that i would like to speak in advance of the vote on behalf of my group 
that did not happen 
i would appreciate it if on the close of this item of business i might be allowed to give an explanation of vote on behalf of my group 
this is an important matter 
it would be useful for the record of the house to state how people perceive what we have just done in the light of their own political analysis 
madam president i do not wish to reopen the debate but i had also asked for the floor to comment on mr barón crespo's motion 
you did not call me either 
i regret this but the vote has already been taken and the decision is made so let us leave the matter there 
i am terribly sorry mr hänsch and mr cox 
i did not see you asking to speak 
even so i think the positions are quite clear and they shall be entered in the minutes 
this seems to me to be a workable solution 
i think this is a better solution than proceeding now to extremely time-consuming explanations of votes 
mr cox mr hänsch would this be acceptable to you 
madam president if the vote records correctly how my group voted i shall not and cannot object to that 
if your ruling is that i cannot give an explanation of vote i accept that but with reservations 
we shall pay particular attention to the wording of the minutes as we always do of course 
if they do not properly reflect the positions adopted then we may correct them if necessary 
commissioner madam president ladies and gentlemen i can be quite frank in saying that i welcome the council's common position on harmonising the training of safety advisers for the transport of dangerous goods by road rail or inland waterway 
thirdly this directive as it currently stands in the common position guarantees in particular because it confines itself exclusively to minimum standards a high degree of flexibility and modest regulation by the european union by adopting it we contribute to the member states' bearing a high level of individual responsibility 
all of this is in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity and is therefore to be greatly welcomed 
our amendments from the first reading have i believe been taken into account very satisfactorily 
they have either been accepted or transposed with no change in the substance or they have been rejected because the corresponding european arrangements have not been included for example a system of penalties for violations of the rules or a complex classification structure for related groups of questions 
the one unanimously adopted amendment of the committee on regional policy and transport which concerns the timetable for implementing the directive is something which i would urge you to support 
by not setting a specific date for the member states to implement the directive and instead giving them a period of three months after its entry into force we are introducing a flexibility clause which ensures that the directive will be implemented without delay 
i would urge you to endorse this 
madam president we cannot and must not accept the fact that we hear ever more frequently of accidents causing major damage on our roads but also on our railways and waterways not solely but at least partly because those involved do not take the transport of dangerous goods seriously enough or because as a result of ignorance or a lack of training on the part of the drivers or others responsible for the various vehicles a minor accident has all too often become a major disaster 
as an austrian i still have a vivid memory as i believe we all do of the catastrophe which cost so many human lives last year in the tauern tunnel where subsequent work to rebuild the parts of the tunnel which had been destroyed in this fire continued for many months at huge expense 
the renovation project which lasted for months cut off this important route between the north and south of europe 
the traffic which had to be diverted because of this stretched the patience of many thousands of people in the eu to the limit 
in fact all hell broke loose in some municipalities in my province 
prevention has to be our answer to disasters of this kind and this draft directive is an important step towards well-trained safety advisers being available so that the right action is taken in good time 
all the same we must not content ourselves with enacting european law to ensure greater safety 
we also need to follow this up and make sure that our rules are transposed by the member states in good time and even more importantly we need to ensure that they are also applied afterwards 
please let this not be yet another sector where we subsequently have to lament the lack of enforcement 
i should like to address one final point 
we must not content ourselves with sealing another hole in the safety net and shutting our eyes to the fact that where transport safety in europe is concerned there is still much more to be done 
in this context i should like to make a request and ask the commissioner responsible who is with us here today to table an appropriate text as soon as possible with a view to continuing to make it safer for traffic to transit tunnels in the future so that we in europe do not have to experience any more such disasters on this scale 
madam president first of all i should like to thank mr koch for his report which has at its heart the issue of transport safety 
the report looks at the issue of harmonising the examination requirements for safety advisors working in the areas of transportation of dangerous goods by road rail and inland waterway 
i congratulate him on his excellent report 
transport safety has sadly been in the news recently the paddington rail crash in london the terrible rail crash in norway the two aviation crashes involving eu citizens and the natural disaster involving the erika off brittany all within the last four months remind us that transport safety can never be taken for granted and that those charged with protecting the public must be highly motivated and highly qualified 
the rapporteur has pointed out to the house that in its common position the council has accepted six of parliament's ten amendments put forward at first reading and that the substance of parliament's other amendments has been retained 
my group will therefore support the common position and looks forward to the enactment of the legislation which will provide us with yet another tool in our fight to make transport in the european union as safe as possible 
when it comes to safety my group will always support any initiatives to improve transport safety 
we still have a lot of work to do in this area as recent events have proved 
madam president i would like to make a few comments 
i would like first of all to thank the rapporteur for his exceptionally accurate and technical work on the report and secondly the commission for the proposal it has submitted 
we are concerned here with the harmonisation of examination requirements but also in fact with minimum requirements 
this is a pity in a sense 
needless to say safety on roads railways and inland waterways is of key importance and given the international nature of these types of transport training for safety advisors should also be harmonised therefore as well as the requirements of the new adr for example which is under way 
this is important but so is enforcement and there are of course a number of reasons why we need to pay particular attention to this 
just think of the road accidents which have occurred over recent years for example in belgium the netherlands and a number of other countries where lorries carrying dangerous goods continued to drive in foggy conditions when really they should have pulled off the road instead 
or ships from eastern europe which moor adjacent to ships over here with all the obvious risks that this entails 
furthermore it has transpired that research in the ports in belgium finland but also in japan has shown that % of containers with partially dangerous cargo are not delivered correctly for shipment 
in short the issue is an important one 
if we look at the situation where safety advisers are concerned in a number of countries it is compulsory to employ such safety advisers in companies as from january of this year 
there will be major problems with enforcing this rule at present especially with smaller companies as these cannot afford safety advisors 
these smaller companies either dispose of their cargo or mix it with other cargo which causes problems 
it is therefore also being requested that iso certificates possibly include the finer details of these activities in the form of annual reports and company analyses 
the work is done 
all that remains is the business of enforcement 
i would like to mention one final point 
with regard to enforcement proper agreements must also be concluded with the eastern european countries because they will not enter into treaties which deal with this matter until july that is to say in eighteen months' time 
this gives them a competitive edge for the interim period 
this is not in itself anything dreadful but we should prioritise particularly the safety aspects for goods transported by road rail and inland waterways and incorporate these as part of the acquis communautaire as soon as possible and present them to the acceding states 
madam president the importance of transport safety is highlighted on a regular basis in this parliament and rightly so 
the ever increasing volume of goods passing through europe entails all kinds of risks known and unknown for employees and the social environment 
those having to deal with these risks should therefore meet stringent requirements 
i am very pleased that agreement has also been reached with the council on minimum standards regarding examinations although i would have preferred it if uniform set standards and modules had been established so that certificates would be of equal value internationally 
this however does not seem feasible 
finally the amendment tabled by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and i can therefore give it my wholehearted support 
mr president commissioner i should first like to congratulate mr koch on his reports which though technical are nonetheless of very great significance for safety 
i should like to make just a few comments 
firstly i should like to ask the commissioner and i am convinced that my request will fall on fertile ground to ensure that more attention is paid to the issue of safety be it on the roads on the waterways or at sea 
considering that it is only today that we are dealing with a commission proposal first made on march even though parliament responded relatively quickly this time lag is a little too long 
this is not just the fault of the commission but i believe that we need to take action more quickly so as to achieve harmonisation in this area as well 
my second point has already been mentioned it concerns the minimum standards 
in principle i believe that in many cases where transport is concerned we should be working towards increased flexibility and country-specific rules 
however when it comes to safety i am rather sceptical because safety in sweden for example is in principle no different from safety in germany italy or austria 
i can live with these minimum standards but i would ask the commission to monitor the situation very carefully 
should flexibility of this kind result in there being inadequate rules in some countries then we should work towards greater harmonisation 
my third point has also been mentioned already 
as you know like mr rack i come from a transit country where this issue plays a particularly important role 
we do not want to make the conditions of competition worse for some countries unilaterally and improve them for countries such as austria or other transit countries 
but i believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum in all countries whether they are transit countries or not 
mr president i would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur mr koch on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road rail or inland waterway 
we understand that it is important that the two institutions parliament and commission cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the committee on regional policy and in particular the transport group is magnificent 
the common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and at second reading we can accept the amendment on the proposed date which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the commission bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question 
as mr simpson has said very correctly this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end 
the process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day 
in this regard i would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels which messrs rack and swoboda have referred to which in the case of austria is doubtless a very sensitive issue and great effort should be made to improve their safety 
in one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves 
margarine and a few kilos of paint which in principle do not present risks led to a genuine disaster 
therefore we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved 
finally i would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport 
this week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport in light of the erika disaster and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport 
but i would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the commission 
as i will say in the debate on the erika disaster we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem 
i would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur mr koch 
the debate is closed 
the vote will take place tomorrow at p.m 
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen the directive on the approximation of the laws of the member states with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road which entered into force on january contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the cen that is the european committee for standardisation 
in particular annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments 
i regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job 
should the european union fail to take action then member states would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period until the cen completes its work which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty 
the amendment to the directive on today's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the community 
the amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity the member states obtain more powers 
the commission decides whether the member states may impose certain rules of their own 
in so doing it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure 
the procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the commission were laid down afresh in the council decision of june 
the proposal to be discussed today to amend the directive on the transport of dangerous goods by road dates from may however and could not therefore take account of the latest comitology procedure 
two of the amendments tabled and adopted unanimously by the committee relate precisely to this amended comitology procedure 
we would like to ensure that there is a reference to this as early as the recitals and that the period within which the council has to make a decision which is not clearly worded is set at a maximum of three months 
in addition the need for greater transparency has been pointed out 
a further amendment allows the member states to impose more stringent requirements in particular for vacuum tanks if work is done or goods are transported as a priority in temperatures well below -20ºc 
this is in the special interest of northern european regions 
a final amendment is intended to ensure that tanks and tankers put into service between january and the entry into force of this directive may continue to be used provided that they have been constructed and maintained in accordance with it 
i do realise that this is only a small step towards increased transport safety but i would ask you to endorse this report 
mr president colleagues a happy new year and millennium to you all 
i am speaking for the first time in this plenary part-session so this is quite exciting for me a little like first love although that did last longer than two minutes 
it is good that this directive should be established now as otherwise member states would have to amend their national acts for a very short time a period of transition which would again mean unnecessary costs and which would once more increase concern with regard to eu bureaucracy 
my amendments concern the frost-resistance ratings for tankers carrying these dangerous goods 
on the shores of the mediterranean it is hard to imagine that in lapland temperatures can fall considerably lower than that 
there is support for the eu in lapland also so let us remember them 
i have thus proposed that the frost rating be lowered to -40ºc 
this would be necessary to keep safety standards at the level they were in northern regions previously 
mr president with your permission i should like to begin by expressing my admiration for the way in which you executed the quick changeover of the chairmanship just now during the debate 
i thought that it was quite superb 
on the subject at hand i think that the people of europe must be able to be confident that the goods however dangerous they are which are transported on europe's roads railways and so on are as safe as possible 
this directive is a contribution to this 
what we are doing today is essentially a nuisance 
the rapporteur mr koch to whom we express our thanks for the work which he has done on this has already pointed out that basically everything could have been somewhat more advanced had it not been for the inactivity on the part of the cen which has been very dilatory in drawing up and adapting the directive 
that is why we can only hope and we should resolve all of this this week that in we will finally have community regulations for the transport of dangerous goods by road so that we have a degree of legal certainty here and also so that our roads are a good deal safer 
commissioner mr president i would first like to thank mr koch for his excellent report which i do not have a great deal to add to 
i would like to take the opportunity just to point out that the transport of dangerous goods continues to cause major problems not just in india where i have just come from but also within the eu 
we only have to think of the serious accident in the mont blanc tunnel about a year ago not to mention the one in the tauern tunnel 
we observe that there is always a possibility of major problems of this kind occurring where nature gives rise to troublesome phenomena such as mist storms or cold weather particularly in the narrow alpine passes 
in general i would urge that the transport of dangerous goods is transferred more to rail 
in this context when planning future railway tracks or motorways a preventative approach should be taken and the appropriate long-term solution built into the process early on 
i would remind you of the brenner base tunnel which has not been touched on even indirectly 
while i am on the subject i would also like to point out that transport problems are one of the key issues facing the eu and call on the commission to give due attention to this 
we need to have much more probing and vigorous debate on cutting-down on transport heavy rail traffic road pricing and railway privatisation with a view to improving functionality 
considering that enlargement towards the east will create a few more problems then it becomes clear to us all that the future credibility of the eu will depend on whether and in what manner we succeed in sorting out the transport situation 
mr president the report we are discussing here does not in itself entail any major changes 
most of the proposed amendments are of a purely technical nature 
it is nonetheless worth emphasising that each time we make this type of decision it is good from a broad environmental perspective and it is beneficial because it creates better prior conditions for exploiting the possibilities of the internal market 
very large quantities of dangerous goods are transported around the eu both on roads and railways and by sea 
this makes it necessary to have proper rules governing transport of this kind 
in area after area we are now obtaining common minimum regulations for the member states 
this is extraordinarily positive and there is cause to thank the rapporteur mr koch for the work he has put in on this issue 
this is also important where the prerequisites for the internal market are concerned 
if we are to get a common transport market genuinely up and running it is important that we should not only have regulations but that these regulations should also as far as possible apply to every country 
i should like to conclude by commenting on a third matter which is also of significance namely an amendment tabled by member of parliament mr ari vatanen 
in many ways the prerequisites differ from one member state to another 
by approving this amendment we take account of the fact that it can be very cold in the northern parts of the european union 
this makes it necessary to also take account of the ways in which materials and packaging are affected by cold of this kind 
it is good that in establishing the present regulations we can also be flexible 
i hope that the commission is able to accept the present amendment 
mr president i would like to thank not only mr koch but also the vice-president of the commission for the clear and unambiguous way in which they have declared their support for safety in the transport sector and acknowledged it as a priority 
the reason mr koch produced his sound report was because the work in the cen and within the united nations economic commission was proceeding none too expeditiously 
i would like to ask the vice-president if she is in a position to tell us today what the state of play is with regard to the efforts towards harmonisation being made by these two organisations and whether the eu is in a position to hasten these harmonisation efforts in accordance with principles that are as simple as possible 
for one thing is clear even if we come to an excellent arrangement within the european union traffic does not stop at our borders it goes beyond them 
hence there is certainly every reason to introduce more far-reaching regional provisions 
if the commissioner is unable to do so today then would she be prepared to inform the committee in writing of how matters stand and what stage negotiations between the cen and the economic commission are at 
mr president i would once again like to congratulate mr koch on his magnificent work on this other report which in a way supplements the debate which we held in october on rail transport 
this debate and the amendment of the directive currently in force allow us to incorporate differentiating elements which demonstrate the diversity of this europe of ours 
a moment ago mr vatanen spoke to us of lower temperatures not of degrees below zero but of degrees below zero 
of course we accept that amendment it is absolutely right and i believe that we should incorporate specific circumstances which demonstrate the climatic diversity of the european union which sometimes take the form of specifics and of concrete requirements for the establishment of standards and characterisations of a technical nature 
lastly mr president the basic problems justifying this amendment of the directive have been pointed out 
we have referred to the delay by the cen the amendment of certain provisions the consistency between the text of the directive and the content of the annexes and the need to for it to be more specific 
the commission accepts all of the contributions of the parliamentary committee and the rapporteur mr koch which are contained in the various amendments specifically four 
we therefore accept the four amendments which have been proposed 
the debate is closed 
the vote will take place tomorrow at p.m 
mr president commissioner ah now i see commissioner fischler is here and there i was thinking that you would not be coming 
welcome to parliament 
ladies and gentlemen we cannot overlook the fact that the benefits of the european internal market are reaped most of all by the wealthy regions and even there they are not enjoyed by all sections of the population 
how long do we actually intend to allow this kind of development to go on for resulting as it does in the widening gulf between poor and wealthy regions 
whilst in the fifth report on the situation in the regions unemployment was seven times higher in the poor regions than in the wealthy regions the sixth report is already talking in terms of it being eight times higher despite the fact that european structural funds are pouring into the regions 
hence it will of course come as no surprise to anyone that the very preamble to the new structural funds regulation places great emphasis on the call for the funds to be implemented more efficiently and in a more concentrated manner in order to achieve the european objectives of high employment levels and sustainable development to name but a few 
parliament but above all the member states demanded massive improvements 
this was very soon forgotten however when the commission developed the new instrument for the purpose the guidelines and wanted to make the requirement for there to be efficiency concentration and simplification of administration in the implementation of the european structural funds more binding 
subsequently the member state governments referred to the principle of subsidiarity and just wanted to get their hands on the money 
and so all that remained of the berlin summit was the indicative nature of the guidelines 
however this at least places the commission under the obligation to approve only those programmes that will actually enable european objectives to be achieved 
i may have my doubts as to whether this indicative instrument will actually succeed in achieving efficiency and increased concentration and in actually putting the european objectives into practice but it is a fact that the guidelines will be of central importance to the negotiations for the community development programme 
if you want our work at european level to be taken seriously then you must also take it seriously yourselves 
parliament was not in a position to go into the content of the guidelines because it was not consulted until the legislative period was long since past 
now that the programming phases are so far on there is little point in starting from scratch again 
that is why in my report i concentrate on the strategic nature of the instrument with the blessing of the committee 
firstly the report assesses the impact of the instrument per se 
secondly it uncovers the shortcomings in the commission document 
for example the question of partnership was simply left out of the central part of the structural funds 
the question as to why it was left out has not been answered to date 
parliament makes demands here that are of central importance 
it expects the commission to only approve those programmes established on the basis of partnerships of this kind 
it surprised me members of the conservative group to suddenly find that amendments aimed at dropping the decentralising approach had been produced overnight 
all i can say is try taking this to your regions and explaining to your electorate why the european principle of decentralisation is not to be put into practice in the regions 
let me tell you you will not escape from that one unscathed 
we cannot have a situation where we agree principles in this house and when it comes to implementing them everyone does their own thing again 
incidentally i would just like to address a comment to the government of my country where there is a desire simply to ignore the horizontal community policy concerning environmental protection and where it was maintained that there was no need to implement the ffh guideline 
i believe it is a good thing that the commission is holding firm here 
this brings me to my final point 
the guidelines must serve as the hard and fast criteria we use to assess whether article of the regulation is actually being implemented 
i expect the commission to ensure that the guidelines which certainly allow for adequate flexibility are in every sense the benchmark for the negotiations 
we represent the european position 
in other words sustainability in transport policy must be taken into account every bit as much as the entitlement of women to a share of financial support as must the fact that each programme should make provision for the overall contribution thus enabling there to be sustainable urban development and truly model projects in rural areas 
this is what i expect the outcome of the community development programmes to be and i do not expect you to give way on this again 
how else otherwise do we propose to reduce the unemployment rate 
not by continuing to wait and trying to cheat our way through again 
we cannot wait 
in a few years time we will no longer be able to spend so much money on implementing european structural policy because a great many more countries will be joining us and then we will have no choice but to create much improved more efficient and more concentrated structures 
and that will only be the beginning 
mr president it is particularly pleasing for me to make my first speech in the european parliament on what is regarded as the most important issue within that part of the united kingdom that i represent in this parliament namely wales 
a major part of wales as you know has been granted objective status under the structural funds programme 
it is quite clear that many people within wales are looking to the european structural funds programme to alleviate some of the great difficulties that we undoubtedly face 
we have seen poverty growing in wales and growing still further since 
we have seen the gap between rich and poor widen 
we are looking therefore within the structural funds programme not just to see industrial restructuring but also to see a wider improvement in the whole of the economic base within the principality 
what is however deeply damaging for us is the belief that in some way the granting of structural funds assistance is something that has been in a sense a success of the government 
it is sadly only a recognition of the very great difficulties that wales faces 
that is why i want to highlight some of the issues that i believe the commission must have at the forefront 
we look to the commission to deal with points in relation to additionality 
we are dissatisfied with the fact that those figures seem to have been in some way hidden within uk figures 
we look to the commission also to ensure that there is matched funding for projects 
we look to it to challenge the uk government to ensure that the private sector which surely must be providing the major impetus for structural funds expenditure is involved in the planning stage 
finally we ask that the commission ensures that structural fund monies are spent in a way which is transparent 
too much of what takes place within this parliament is not transparent 
this is one area in which i believe the commission can be a very great friend to wales 
mr president our committee views these issues very differently and to start i will speak from the point of view of research 
this will be possible with action on the part of governments and such decentralisation of higher education will be an unquestionably useful policy in evening out development 
another matter we would like to address specifically from the point of view of industrial policy is that we would have liked the commission to pay more attention to the effects of services electronic commerce and the growing use of the internet when they were planning the coordination of structural funds and cohesion funds 
poverty and wealth used to depend more on means of livelihood 
the rich areas were those where there were jobs in industry but today those areas might have become a burden and they may well be poor meaning we also have to invest in new sectors of industry such as electronic production as i might call it and the production of services because they are the industries of the future 
finally as the committee representing energy we would have liked the issue of support for renewable energy resources from cohesion and regional development funds to have been emphasised still more thus through a process of coordination increasing the use of renewables so that the scant funding resources in the energy programme might have been compensated by means of these more substantial sums 
mr president i would very much like to thank mrs schroedter for the work she has done on this and to explain to colleagues that i am speaking for my colleague mrs flautre who followed this for the committee on employment and social affairs but who is unfortunately ill 
i would like to draw people's attention to amendments nos and which were agreed by the committee on employment and social affairs but not accepted by the committee on regional policy transport and tourism 
these amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and support financially local schemes to develop employment opportunities and strengthen social cohesion 
in the past this parliament has viewed the social economy as an important potential provider of employment 
these amendments also fit in with this parliament's view that social exclusion is a serious issue needing constructive action 
we hope that those considering rejection of these amendments have very powerful reasons to offer to both parliament and their citizens who are seeking employment 
in her report mrs flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is sorely lacking yet desperately needed 
the commission proposals refer to the four pillars of employment strategy and the five fields of action of the european social fund 
but the lack of specific guidelines here is particularly to be regretted as the idea of linking social fund assistance to the employment strategy will be put into effect for the first time during the programme 
it could be said that the omission gives the impression that the commission too has no idea how to provide maximum coordination between european social fund assistance which is subject to review after three and a half years and the member states' annual national plans for employment 
we hope that the commission can reassure us that this was an oversight which is now being dealt with constructively 
mr president commissioner the proposal presented by the commission in accordance with its mandate is a reasonable starting point for the committee on agriculture and rural development 
this as well as the deficiencies in the networks of infrastructures and services and a generally very low level of employment which furthermore is seasonal and lacks diversity exacerbates the exodus from rural areas 
the consequences do not inspire hope 
it is the young people who are disappearing who are getting an education and finding work outside of the rural areas all of which has an unfavourable effect on those areas 
this lack of infrastructure is also an obstacle to the establishment of companies and the creation of jobs 
we have to remember that rural areas represent almost four fifths of the territory of the european union 
agriculture only provides % of employment in the union 
furthermore three quarters of our farm workers are part-time and require supplements to their incomes 
for this reason one of the most important and essential objectives which we should set in the european union is to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas outside of the agricultural sector in sectors such as rural tourism sport culture heritage conservation the conversion of businesses new technologies services etc 
however even though the role of agriculture is not exclusive it is still essential not only to prevent economic and social disintegration and the creation of ghost towns but also because farmers play a fundamental role in managing the land in preserving biodiversity and in protecting the environment 
therefore we support the establishment of an agricultural and rural development policy which is consistent with the objectives we have set 
we want rural areas at the dawn of the century to be competitive and multi-functional both with regard to agriculture and with regard to opening up to the diversity of non-agricultural activities 
it is important to prioritise general criteria for land planning and demographic equilibrium and to bear in mind the conclusions of the committee on agriculture and rural development on the five fundamental issues which have been only partly taken up by the committee on transport regional policy and tourism in its points and 
in conclusion i would ask the commission to take these five points into account when establishing the conclusions on the four pillars because i believe that for the european union maintaining the population in rural areas must be one of the priority objectives 
mr president commissioner i would like to begin by thanking mrs schroedter the rapporteur for her work 
i think that this work has been carried out extremely well 
i would also like to thank her for her willingness to enter into dialogue with the other political groups when compromise formulas have needed to be reached in the face of this avalanche of amendments and perhaps there are more of them than we expected but which genuinely reflect the importance of the report we are now discussing 
we feel that it is important that the commission takes account of the conclusions adopted by this parliament at least in spirit because at this stage it might seem as though what we are doing here is a useless exercise and nothing but hot air 
the truth of the matter though is that we believe and this is also shown in the way the conclusions have been drafted that the commission must take account of what is adopted by this parliament particularly in the face of an interim revision of these directives 
in our amendments we have stated the importance of the necessary synergies being produced between the structural funds the cohesion fund and community initiatives so that their application should be reflected in the best and most profitable way by the gradual elimination of disparities between regions and by the creation of jobs which are when all is said and done the two central purposes of the funds we are discussing 
in order to achieve a more rapid and efficient boost for attaining these objectives we think that those who generate employment the real entrepreneurs and those who really guarantee new sources of employment that is businesspeople must participate in this initiative 
small and medium-sized businesses above all need to take part in the distribution of these funds 
if they do not if businesspeople feel marginalised if entrepreneurs cannot take part not only in managing but also in receiving these funds we will have missed an opportunity to attain our objectives more rapidly 
also in order to attain our objectives to overcome the disparities between regions and to seek out sources of employment it is crucial to give our complete support to new technologies to transport and communications networks and to renewable energies 
all of this must be done i repeat with the participation of private business which by uniting its efforts with those of public administrations but complementing them never obstructing or excluding them will lead to the creation of wealth in society and of jobs 
mr president it is incumbent upon me to remind my colleague mr evans of why wales actually achieved objective status 
it was because of the discredited policies of his own conservative party 
let me also remind him that when his party leader mr hague was secretary of state for wales he broke every rule in the book on additionality which led to a stern letter from commissioner wulf-mathies regarding regulatory requirements 
i can tell you that the british government is aware of its regulatory requirements on objective additionality 
i suggest mr evans goes back and reads the regulation 
my group has made extensive amendments to both reports up for debate today 
i want to focus our minds on the essential role of the guidelines 
the objective is to provide a framework and tool to support and enhance economic regeneration to get the most effective use of resources in the widest partnership and to put these regions back on the road to recovery and sustainable development so that eventually they come off the regional life-support machine 
it is important to identify the skills and potential of our regions in the hi-tech sector 
it is particularly important in the light of reports in the media that europe is rapidly losing ground to the us in the hi-tech growth industries of the future 
the operation of the previous round of programmes is also very instructive in telling us what guidelines should not be about 
they should not be about creating additional layers of bureaucracy and red tape 
they should not be about shifting priorities and policies halfway through project development resulting in inevitable delays and underspends particularly in the light of the new budgetary requirement 
the implementation and operation of the guidelines cannot be left to the personal interpretation of one or other desk officer either in the commission or in the civil service 
there must be an internal coherence in the commission directorate while respecting the specific local and regional aspects of commission programmes 
the conclusion is that we must make the case for guidelines to be broad indicative and flexible to assist our programme managers and fund-users and to get the maximum potential out of our new fields of regeneration 
if we can inject a spirit of entrepreneurial activity into our poor and structurally weak regions we will eventually get them back onto the road of attracting substantial investor confidence which will be the key to future success 
this is how we are going to judge the success of these guidelines whether eu regional policy with a good solid enabling guideline can open up new opportunities and allow our poor and structurally weak regions to play their full part in contributing to the growth and prosperity of the eu 
mr president commissioner i would like to thank mrs schroedter for an excellent report 
she has gone into the issue in some depth and in the committee debate she took account of many of the amendments that have been tabled regarding this report 
the rapporteur has also quite rightly stated that parliament was not heard in time regarding the guidelines 
we are badly behind now in this matter 
hopefully the stands parliament has taken will help however in the mid-term appraisal of the programmes and in their practical implementation 
for the time the report grew too large when it was being debated 
it contained details and issues that had already been raised in previous reports 
at this stage it is more important to concentrate on assessing how we can use this process to steer union regional policy bearing in mind that the aim is to reduce regional inequality 
our group emphasises the importance of the principle of subsidiarity the responsibility of member states and the role of local players in drafting and implementing programmes 
it is especially important to get smes involved in the planning and implementation of programmes 
our group also considers it important to take greater account of remote and peripheral areas and wishes to increase interaction between towns and rural areas 
we oppose the excessive control the central administration of the union and its member states exercises and we are calling for a reduction in the bureaucracy that has taken root in the drafting and implementation of programmes 
projects implemented with support from the union have had their effect watered down all too often by slow decision making and complicated administrative processes 
funds have often been granted for projects which have had no lasting benefit for the area concerned 
projects have to be carried out more efficiently more flexibly and they have to be made more productive 
for us new members it was the first time and this was a very interesting process 
this report is very good and our group supports it 
bearing this in mind this house should in any event demand that before the community support frameworks for the period in question are approved they be studied and submitted for debate in this parliament specifically in light of the guidelines that we have presented today 
this is because we think that they are particularly able to create employment in the poorest and least-developed regions and we would thus contribute to reversing the harmful trends towards inequality that exist in european society and to the move towards a fairer europe 
mr president we should not forget that the main strategic objective of the structural and cohesion funds and of their coordination is to achieve economic and social cohesion 
we are obliged to participate in drafting directives and also in assessing their results 
we are obliged to do so because we are the representatives of the citizens in a europe of citizens and not just in a europe of states and of regions 
we feel that the funds are a necessary but insufficient condition for achieving economic and social cohesion 
we might be mistaken in using the gross domestic product per inhabitant as the sole indicator 
some speakers have already mentioned unemployment and the fall in population 
we will have to study several indicators which will enable us to see the current state of regional societies that are in a worse situation than others and how they are evolving 
this fact means that the european parliament the commissioner and the commission must act decisively and strategically 
i agree that the european parliament did not have the opportunity or that it was not given the opportunity as we had reached the end of the parliamentary term to discuss the directives 
i do not think however that this report has come too late 
we need to consider it together so that the new objective programmes and the plans for regional development which have been drafted before the directives come into force can be submitted for revision and proper assessment 
we all agree that we should ask that halfway through these programmes when the assessment of the directives is made parliament should be given an equally influential role on the grounds that we are the citizens' representatives 
our citizens cannot accept that the european union takes decisions in a way that is at least on the face of it bureaucratic 
they need to see the political dimension working to see that officials accept their responsibilities and that there is communication with the citizens 
this is what we are today asking the commissioner for 
i would like to think that given his previous experience as a regional president he will agree to propose indicators and a strategy which will favour economic and social cohesion and not just productivity 
mr president i support the main proposals of the report concerning the administration of the structural funds and the cohesion fund for the period and the main recommendations of the report which include the following there must always be an integrated approach to the spending of eu structural and cohesion funds 
this means that there must be a comprehensive partnership between local authorities and national governments with regard to how these funds are to be spent 
member states are urged to attach greater importance to integrated strategies for revitalising relations between towns and rural areas 
this latter point is of particular importance 
while urban renewal in our cities is very important we must always strike a balance in our policies between promoting rural development and improving the lives of city dwellers 
we do not want to build a europe of cities alone 
the structural funds have played a key role in the development both of urban and rural parts of peripheral countries mainly through the upgrading of roads water treatment and related transport networks 
this process will continue in accordance with the financial spending guidelines laid down by the eu leaders at their berlin summit last year which were supported by parliament at its last may plenary part-session 
key eu programmes between and have certainly helped to improve the economic competitiveness of peripheral countries and objective regions within europe 
the key now is to consolidate and make permanent the progress made to date 
this would ensure that the peripheral countries and the ultraperipheral regions the poorer regions in europe are in a position to operate successfully within the new euro currency zone as well as within an ever-expanding internal market where the free movement of goods persons services and capital exist 
in conclusion while key infrastructure projects have been supported by the european regional development fund and the cohesion fund we should remember that the european social fund has played a very important role in helping the less well-off in our society 
the social fund has certainly improved our third-level institutions financed our post-leaving certificate programmes and put in place comprehensive schemes to help combat youth and long-term unemployment assist early school leavers and promote higher standards of adult literacy 
mr president on numerous occasions in the past i have disagreed with the rapporteur on her approach to regional policy issues 
this time however i actually agree with her 
whether or not this will encourage her to continue along the same path i cannot say 
nevertheless i would like to commend her on her work 
the second point i would like to make is that we would have preferred it if the guidelines had been added to the regulation in the form of an annex as we and mrs mccarthy as rapporteurs for the general regulation had asked 
unfortunately this did not happen 
mr bernié is not to blame for this as it was a matter for the previous committee 
thirdly we broadly agree on the general guidelines provided they do not deviate from the comments we have made so far 
they are particularly beneficial to the member states and i would particularly like to draw your attention to the emphasis the commission has placed on the issues of sustainable development job creation and more particularly on equal opportunities and transport issues 
personally i at least am totally in favour of the guidelines 
as an islander however i would like to express my dissatisfaction at the lack of recognition of island development 
this is not the first time that this issue has not been given the consideration it deserves 
this has been an ongoing concern for the five years that i have been a member of this parliament and i have raised the issue time and time again 
commissioner we shall continue to raise the issue as article paragraph of the treaty of amsterdam provides for an integrated policy for islands 
therefore the commission should address the issue once and for all 
the time has come to implement the programmes and so member states should also assume their responsibilities and do their jobs properly 
as for us in parliament i would like to remind you of the code of conduct between the commission and parliament which was signed in may 
i am absolutely certain that this code will be observed and that parliament will keep abreast of all the developments and details concerning the implementation of the programmes 
mr president commissioner in this minute and a half i should like first of all to congratulate mrs schroedter 
i know many have already done so but she has indeed earned our praise for being particularly open and attentive to proposals from all sides and i think it is this openness which has given her report the quality we see today 
i share the regrets she expressed namely that parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that i cannot see this report having any sort of immediate effect which in my view is a pity 
consequently i feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid-term review in and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 
in brief i would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face 
the first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies 
subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking 
we must ask ourselves a fundamental question how can we ensure that union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development 
the second challenge is that of enlargement which will of course have a considerable impact both in budgetary and geographical terms 
these are two areas of action which i invite the commissioner to set up and in which i would ask him to involve us 
finally in this time of natural disasters i would just like to mention the issue of the use of structural funds 
as you know it is up to each state to redistribute part of the total appropriation 
europe should not be completely absent as the states tend to want 
public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being unavailable to give a response even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations 
i think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear 
i also think we should ensure or ask member states to ensure that there is some publicity given to european aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents 
mr president the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form 
as far as french planning experts are concerned for example the most probable scenario today is that of the entrenchment of regional disparities within each country 
well the structural funds have helped to apply a brake to this process 
our project of a europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator 
its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the structural funds 
what we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at european level 
the commission however though bound to issue guidelines does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner 
the report put forward today re-establishes its place in the political sphere 
it is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development 
this is what persuades us to vote in favour of it 
mr president i too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work 
over the coming years faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement europe will more than ever before require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy 
to this end europe as a whole and each member state individually will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities including the structural funds 
for this to be possible what we need from the european commission are not just good intentions but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the member states 
for example in recent years italy has had problems in utilising the structural funds mainly because of excessive bureaucracy insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level 
firstly we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided 
secondly a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent since they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated to the point of hindering access to the funds 
this is something about which european small and medium-sized businesses in particular tend to complain 
mr president like my colleague mr evans it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this house on this very important issue especially since i represent a part of the united kingdom the west midlands which has hitherto benefited from objective funding in particular 
but the report before the house tonight is a prime example of how if we are not very careful we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them 
the report itself is well-intentioned but as so often when we deal with these issues lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability 
that is why i and my group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text not to take anything away from the proposal but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide 
i would like to explain our thinking here 
firstly we are concerned with the proper use of the structural and cohesion funds 
past experience dictates that as the elected representatives of the european taxpayer we should and indeed must demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as value for money indicators in the grant-giving process 
next we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period 
but at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful 
our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer but we also avoid the well-rehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad 
finally we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed 
there should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation 
also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects which are hard to monitor towards capital schemes where in the majority of cases the benefits are there for all to see 
that way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the european parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform 
if these changes to the report are supported by the house today i believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about namely to assist in a financially sustainable manner those deprived areas of the european union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living not by giving a hand-out but by giving a hand-up 
i urge the house to support these changes 
mr president commissioner i too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work 
despite the steps taken thus far these levels are still very high and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment 
these policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines 
let us not forget that when these policies are effective they also benefit european citizens by directly improving their quality of life 
let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the european union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development unless of course the commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the european mainland 
in closing i would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium for which we all hope for the best 
quite briefly structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way rather it aggravates it 
the agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers particularly in the south 
regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the member states 
if we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities 
little consideration if any at all has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure transport communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation 
unfortunately the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented 
mr president i would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the union 
the first is the fundamental central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion 
we are concerned to hear news that the commission is taking this objective less seriously 
secondly i agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and i would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention 
in future we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as in my country the islands of the azores and madeira 
mr president first of all i would like to thank the rapporteur not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made 
mr president commissioner the guidelines are intended to help steer the member states towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes 
nonetheless their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities 
i agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the member states on simplifying administration and i support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive small and medium-sized enterprises on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields 
i am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my group to paragraph to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects 
i should be very grateful mrs schroedter if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations 
mr president commissioner in the committee on employment and social affairs we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the structural and cohesion funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women 
they are growing but only in terms of gdp 
they are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions 
commissioner please read the opinion of the committee on employment and social affairs and treat it as a matter of priority because this is our citizens' greatest problem 
please take account in strategic terms in the revision and in the allocation of reserves of employment needs because this fundamentally is what the structural funds and the cohesion funds require 
mr president it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven-year period so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation particularly for women and young people and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy 
it is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas employment in rural areas aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the european union and for the greek islands which of course comprise half of the islands of the union as stipulated in article of the treaty 
cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable 
everyone understands mrs schroedter ladies and gentlemen the reasons and the time limits involved and i shall come back to this point presently and whatever the time limits or delays since we are discussing this report right now as the representative for the commission i consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming 
mrs schroedter you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the member states and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters european union cofinancing of the programmes requires and is the justification for a situation where community priorities as debated and approved in this house should also be taken into account in order to promote this community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out 
so ladies and gentlemen i should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you mrs schroedter and the various members of this house have made 
regarding the role and structure of these guidelines mr hatzidakis mrs schroedter and mrs mccarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of structural fund objectives and as well as their links with the cohesion funds 
the objective is that these priorities should contribute to the better use to the optimum and efficient use as some of you have wished of community involvement including mr bradbourn using if necessary the performance reserve which is specifically intended to encourage the optimum and efficient use of european public monies 
when i speak of optimum utilisation i am referring both to the national and regional levels 
and so mr seppänen i shall also mention at this point speaking of the national level the link with the cohesion fund 
this is the purpose of these guidelines 
regarding their content as you know ladies and gentlemen of this house they are focused on three strategic priorities that your rapporteur pointed out very clearly but at the same time very passionately as i understood her presentation just now 
the first priority is to improve the competitiveness of regional economies in order to create in all sectors but especially in the private sector as mr berend said the maximum number of serious worthwhile and permanent jobs the competitiveness of regional economies all regional economies and in particular mr evans that of wales but not only of wales 
and because there are a number of you who have just pointed out what appeared to you to be an omission let me also add the regional economies of the european regions handicapped by their distance from the centre be they remote regions island regions or of course the most remote regions which are naturally the most distant 
perhaps i may inform mr ribeiro e castro who asked me about this that as i wrote to the presidents of each of these most remote regions the commission did indeed request an extension of several weeks before publishing its anticipated report 
concerning the most remote regions it was only quite belatedly that we received the memorandums from the various governments but this is not necessarily an excuse just an explanation 
we must therefore take these memorandums into consideration and produce an extremely thorough piece of work 
i myself took part in a meeting of the most remote regions on november and within the college we considered that we would need several more weeks before being able to produce a report that dealt appropriately with the extremely serious problems and lived up to the expectations of these most remote regions 
i would thank you for your understanding in this matter 
so that is the first priority the competitiveness of regional economies 
the second priority which several of you have stressed mr puerta in particular but there were others not that i am mentioning them in any order of priority is the strengthening of social cohesion and of employment particularly by raising the profile of human resources far more so than in the past 
ladies and gentlemen we now have a european union where the disparities between countries are observed to be less great proving the effectiveness and worth of the cohesion fund but where at the same time in relation to unemployment as you wrote mrs schroedter an increasing gap exists between the or richest regions and the or poorest or most disadvantaged regions 
this is a situation which is as it should be unjustifiable and intolerable 
as far as i am concerned taking into account my own concept of the construction of europe and regional development policy in particular this is a situation which i find unacceptable and i have every intention as far as possible with your support of dedicating all the appropriations for which i am responsible to this improved social human and territorial cohesion particularly in order to prevent what i once called in this house a two-speed europe a europe of wealthy districts but at the same time a europe of impoverished areas 
the third objective is urban and rural development within the scope of a balanced territorial policy 
in fact the guidelines take two horizontal principles into account 
the first is rural development and let me say mrs schroedter that i am including in rural development the matter of sustainable transport an issue i have been involved in personally for a long time 
i particularly remember the time when i was minister for the environment in my own country 
the second principle is that of equal opportunities particularly for men and women as well as the european strategy for employment and the context of economic and monetary union 
finally and in order to respond to the concerns which you have expressed in this house particularly yourself mrs schroedter in these guidelines we recall the importance and the definition of integrated strategies for development or redevelopment which of all the priorities offer the maximum opportunity to synergy to the measures undertaken and to the establishment of a decentralised partnership 
you expressed some concern about what might look like a lack of reference to this partnership yet there is a clear reference to it on page of the guidelines 
however i do wish to mention since you have asked me to do so that as far as i am concerned this partnership and i spent long enough as a regional administrator within my own country to be able to say this most sincerely is a tool one used to involve local brainpower be it in the public sector in the form of elected representatives the social and educational sectors associations or in the private sector a decentralised partnership and let me mention in this connection in response to mrs angelilli the territorial pacts which are one of the means available to this decentralised partnership 
these are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities since they must be taken into consideration under each of the objectives to different extents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the member states and regions 
i should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made ladies and gentlemen and firstly on procedure 
it is true that consultation with parliament has only come about at a late date 
let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the commission in the form of a draft in february in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text my predecessor mrs wulf-mathies presented them to parliament immediately 
due to the elections to the european parliament taking place around this time however parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted in july 
here in this chamber ladies and gentlemen among you i wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning mr hatzidakis asked me a question about this as far as member states are concerned your observations will certainly be taken into consideration 
and let me assure you furthermore that when the commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid-term review in mind in line with the regulations then the point of view of this house as expressed in this report will also be taken into account 
now to the form 
on the subject of the role of the guidelines mrs schroedter you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of european objectives often very precise ones should be provided 
i shall not list them all but they include implementing intersectoral policies increasing efficiency in the use of public funds assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together etc 
the commission takes note of these but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents such as the guide to the reform of the structural funds or the methodological working document 
drawing to a close i should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated mrs schroedter 
i am thinking for example of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations 
the commission kept to the actual text of article of the structural funds regulations which stipulates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide member states with broad indicative guidelines on relevant and agreed community policies 
i actually quoted the text itself in quotation marks 
moreover the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes 
you then mentioned mrs schroedter the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration 
i find the opposite the case 
i wish to confirm the great importance the commission attaches and shall attach to the urban dimension of our cohesion policy 
indeed i had occasion recently to say as much to all the ministers responsible for urban policy at a meeting in tampere 
it must however be stressed that the guidelines under discussion are related only to the structural funds whose objectives and specifically adopt the diversification of rural society as a priority 
and indeed on the subject of the balance of rural society let us not forget that there is also the new rural development policy cofinanced by the eaggf guarantee section aimed at promoting reform in european agriculture and supporting the multifunctional aspect of agriculture 
at this stage i would simply like to say that i would like to see it integrated into the programming for objective rural areas in the way that the eaggf guidance section is for objective regions 
in any event i appreciate the vigilance of your committee on agriculture and rural development in this matter 
before concluding i should like to tell mr savary that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck france austria and germany in particular in the last few weeks and at the same time we shall once again be discussing together with my fellow commissioner mrs de palacio what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of france 
i shall therefore reserve the right if you permit sir to give you my own opinion which to a great extent matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil spillage using objective 
i shall remind you that the commission is going to be approving the objective zoning plans for france sweden austria and luxembourg tomorrow 
we shall then have an appropriate tool for working particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms 
indeed this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the french departments which have been severely disabled by the storms 
in conclusion with thanks for your understanding mr president i should like to thank you mrs schroedter for the quality of your work and that of the committee and to tell you that i am very pleased apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines 
we have discussed this and i have attempted to clarify my point of view 
i am very pleased with the level of support offered by your house to the commission in establishing these guidelines which have been submitted to the member states for information when establishing their own programmes 
this can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current programmes 
i feel this augurs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions at this time when programming for the period is being undertaken good joint working practice which is mr hatzidakis backed up by something i am very attentive to observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions 
the debate is closed 
the vote will take place tomorrow at p.m 
the report demonstrates that measured in terms of gross domestic product per capita the poorest regions are beginning to catch up and that is how the situation is set to continue 
this can largely be attributed to the structural funds even though the disparity between the poorest and wealthiest regions is still considerable 
employing european structural funds has already enabled convergence in standards of living 
over a ten year period the gap in average gdp has been reduced by ten percent 
this has particularly affected the four cohesion countries in the positive sense of course as it has the five former east german länder 
unfortunately this european-wide development was due in the main to an increase in productivity and only partly to an increase in the level of employment 
hence we would urge the commission and the member states to give due attention to the effect measures have on employment in future 
however this has dampened the effect of structural policy on employment 
this is not an assessment but for the moment merely an observation 
the report establishes however that regional differences in the labour market have in fact continued to increase 
unemployment is currently at % in of the weakest regions 
ten years ago it was % lower i.e % 
and i might just mention that in the best regions unemployment averages % it was % ten years ago hence there has been an increase of only % 
the report makes clear the fact that % of unemployment is structural unemployment 
that is why and this is the conclusion we can draw from this report promoting competitiveness within industry and infrastructure for economic activity must be central to the structural policy in that order 
the corollary to this it has to be said is that measures for the retraining and ongoing training of the work force are of no small importance either 
in addition more attention must be given to boosting entrepreneurial potential in small and medium-sized enterprises and the services they call upon must be developed further 
another conclusion to be drawn from the report is that if financial support is to be utilised efficiently then the measures must be brought into line with the broadly diversified means of support intended to establish a middle-class and minimum standard of living 
a very important point to my mind 
in the conclusions of this report we make the commission aware that the legal bases for cooperation between regions and member states and applicant countries must be improved and point to how crucial it is for the budget to be consolidated as a prerequisite to the success of economic and monetary union and enlargement eastwards 
we call upon those member states that have not yet submitted a satisfactory map of development regions to do so immediately and of course we expect the commission to examine with due haste the operational programmes for the regions for the new support period to in the light of the results of the sixth periodic report and to do everything possible to enable this support period to commence without delay in those areas where it is needed and in the proper manner 
mr president commissioner this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the european union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report 
i consider however that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in europe offers a somewhat over-simplified view of the situation and unfortunately this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches 
the commission report generally relativises this observation particularly when it refers to the social and economic situation of some regions of the union in which i have a special interest by which i mean the french overseas departments and more generally the most remote regions 
finally in my view this sixth periodic report presents interesting arguments from the viewpoint of a real project for the balanced sustainable development of europe particularly when it outlines the importance of relations between the central areas of europe and its more remote regions 
mr president the group of the party of european socialists in this parliament agrees with the report that mr berend has just presented and congratulates the author both on the quality of his conclusions and on his flexibility which ensured that the different groups were able to incorporate amendments in committee 
furthermore this is at a time when technological development economic globalisation and our problems which are enlargement and the single currency demand that the regions as well as businesses and individuals make more of an effort to be competitive 
i shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur one positive and one negative 
the first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the union and that the community funds have been a major although not decisive factor in reducing regional inequalities 
the negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the european regions' gdp and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment 
it is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation 
this commissioner is the first commandment for the coming period 
thus mr president i ask my fellow members to approve this report and i ask the commission as other speakers have done to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 
mr president commissioner i would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it 
the report shows that growth has been uneven despite all our efforts 
very rapid growth is continuing in central europe 
the strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general european average whereas many southern european and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly 
we now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas 
is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences long distances climates that are too cold or too hot sparse populations and austere conditions 
how can the union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development 
the member states must also bear in mind their responsibility 
some member states have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the union has been increased 
this has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced 
in the future we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place 
for example uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration 
in this connection too weight has to be given to the decisive importance of smes as employers and forces behind regional development 
it is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know-how 
our group is in favour of adopting this report 
we have a serious situation in which in the european union today there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached on average % in the regions worst affected regions which also happen to be poor areas whilst in the regions with the lowest unemployment corresponding to the richer areas unemployment stands at just % 
given this situation the report approved by parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes which are often misspent with centralised state policies and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication systems with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the trans-european rail networks which are due in 
only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects 
the overarching objectives of the structural funds such as job creation boosting equality of opportunity increasing the sustainability of employment and development are only mentioned in passing 
this attitude appears to me to be unjustified 
i would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report 
this does not mean that i do not see the need for competitiveness particularly as i myself am an entrepreneur in an objective region that is in brandenburg in the federal republic of germany and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises 
it is absolutely crucial that parallel temporary measures be introduced in the objective regions that is to say job creation measures special programmes for supporting employment opportunities for women and initiatives to help people set up their own business 
they are supported by appropriate european union structural fund activities 
supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development simply because there is no basis for a self-supporting upturn in these objective regions 
after all the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substantiates the fact than an increase of at least % in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all 
concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand-orientated economic policy is not the answer 
and those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and to a lesser extent in rationalisation 
it is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand-orientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas 
the situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions 
in other words what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there 
for example these would be measures for vocational training for further education for re-integrating people who have already been excluded from the production process for the flexibilisation of working time and working time arrangements in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again 
mr president my compliments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report 
the key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the european union 
by stimulating a diversity of investments the european union is endeavouring to increase the gdp per capita and to boost employment 
from the sixth periodic report on the regions one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect 
the efforts made in order to drive up the gdp per capita in objective regions do not always result in such an increase not really a satisfying result over a period during which certainly over the past couple of years there has been economic growth 
as indicated by the rapporteur the effects of the structural measures on the other hand are minimal as far as employment is concerned 
some reservation about the effectiveness of community aid is therefore called for 
also the observation that the disparities between regions within member states sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions 
mr president it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities especially in connection with boosting employment 
it is after all they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit 
by allowing them to develop tailor-made plans for the relevant regions and if necessary tying this in with financial aid a higher return can be achieved 
surely this must be the ultimate goal 
i am therefore in favour of the commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the member states and regions 
following on from this it is probably also more meaningful with regard to the financial aid to regions to give member states more say anyway 
by shifting the criteria from the regions to the member states we can avoid a great deal of problems later on 
finally i would like to draw attention to the position of the central and eastern european countries 
the report shows that in general they are a long way behind eu countries especially in terms of gdp per capita 
with the planned accession of a large number of these countries in the foreseeable future it is a matter of urgency to review the current structural policy 
i would like to take this opportunity to follow the example of others and call on the commission to submit proposals for reform sooner rather than later 
mr president commissioner following close scrutiny of this report one cannot escape the conclusion that it was possible to fulfil the stated objective of the structural policy only in part 
for example whilst the disparities between the regions have increased rather than decreased there has been a certain amount of convergence between the member states themselves in this respect 
equally unemployment levels in the worst affected regions barely fell at all indeed they rose in some cases 
i wonder why it is that the structural funds are not employed more efficiently 
even the accumulation of money from the cohesion funds and the structural funds has failed to have the desired effect in all regions and countries 
since it is the declared aim of all politicians throughout europe to reduce unemployment then one must pose the critical question as to whether the policy employed is the right one or whether it would not be more appropriate to boost the competitiveness of the regions by appropriate measures such as increased support for research and development improvements in infrastructure and raising the level of training 
genuine structural reforms and a competition-friendly taxation policy are the cornerstones of a successful economic base 
if we do not wish to stand accused of pursuing a cost-intensive structural policy that does nothing to improve the unemployment situation in the long term then the measures drawn up so far must be analysed 
we will only be able to say that the structural policy of the union has been a success when we manage to create a sufficient number of jobs and when there is a significant reduction in the unemployment rate 
mr president commissioner my thanks go to the rapporteur for handling this very important report because developments in the social and economic situation will decide to what extent the citizens of europe will judge that we have been successful in our work 
this issue which has an impact on their everyday life is a key issue as regards eu credibility 
it has to be conceded that the eu has already aided i would say quite magnificently the development of poor countries 
i remember what portugal and greece used to be like when i drove through those countries for the first time twenty-five years ago 
in this connection french speakers would speak of a coup de chapeau in other words i take my hat off to the eu 
the eu really deserves such a gesture but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great 
what is the result 
people react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust 
consequently we have to build schools hospitals and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over 
this is very costly and it also causes very great social problems 
most people however would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised if they were given the chance to in other words if there was work there 
we must give them this opportunity 
this is a moral obligation the eu and all of us have 
the solution as i see it lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship 
by entrepreneurship i do not simply mean the ownership of business but creating will 
i mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life whether he or she is an employee the owner of a business or an official 
what is a fair society 
one in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children 
in this way positive development of the regions is also possible because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance 
finally i would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from america where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of envy as it often is here in europe 
mr president commissioner as my time is limited i shall get straight to the point 
firstly let me make a statement of fact the fruits of growth are not distributed equitably within the union 
the most remote regions still hard hit by catastrophic unemployment rates offer one example of this 
in reunion for example the rate is % 
this is not a situation related to the economic climate however rather it is a structural problem created by our remoteness our insularity in short our own specific personality 
it only remains to put this principle into practice 
the commission document expected to be ready in december was delayed until january then february and the initial thinking does not fill me with much optimism 
i therefore appeal formally to the council and the commission 
as regards taxation state aid the structural funds and defending our traditional products practical measures characterised by daring and ambition must be planned as a matter of urgency 
if these do not materialise then unfortunately convergence and cohesion will remain no more than words for us and it is to be feared that the structural policy undertaken in our regions despite the size of the amounts committed will end in failure 
mr president as all the previous speakers have done i should like in turn to thank mr berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report 
just like the previous report this extremely competent and precise analysis the recommendations it supports and your own comments ladies and gentlemen shall prove useful to the commission in general and to the commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for 
i should also like to make a few comments firstly mr berend regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report 
you pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote if i am not mistaken that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports 
on behalf of all the officials of the commission and my predecessor mrs wulf-mathies i must inform you that we were very alert to the evaluation made by this house and by yourself 
the commission was certainly very anxious to ensure mr berend that this sixth periodic report should show that progress had been made and a threshold crossed in terms of the quality of the analysis submitted to you 
i am thinking in particular of the contents of chapter of this report where the commission examined in greater detail the economic definitions of regional competitiveness and attempted to analyse the extent to which this competitiveness may be supported improved and influenced by factors which some of you mr markov just now and mrs raschhofer stressed very forcefully 
i am thinking of technological research and development infrastructure provision and quality human resources potential small and medium-sized businesses and direct investment from abroad 
so much for the quality 
i do not wish to spend time right now mr berend going into details regarding my opinion of the general points which your house has already endorsed 
let me just itemise them the first point concerns the usefulness of the conclusions of this report in drawing up the priorities of the new regional policy particularly for the negotiation of programming documents with the member states 
secondly partnership a subject which a number of you stressed the role of local and regional authorities the private sector both sides of industry associations and local community action groups 
regarding this problem of partnership i shall be extremely attentive to ensuring that the terms of the structural funds regulations are applied properly 
thirdly the need to develop the employment side of growth even though i am aware as mr van dam just said that the prime responsibility is that of the member states and that when we speak of the responsibility of member states and indeed of the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy we must clearly establish what sort of period we are working in 
mr fruteau stated just now that the fruits of growth were distributed inequitably 
mr fruteau we at least need to recognise that there is growth and that we are not working in a period of stagnation or recession as has been the case in the past 
you will tell me that situations of growth or shortage do not affect everyone alike 
i agree with your analysis 
when there is growth it must be better distributed but a matter that is even more difficult and which more seriously affects the regions handicapped by their remoteness be they the most remote or island regions is the lack of growth which generally characterised the last two decades 
fourthly a point which mrs hedkvist petersen stressed just now the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people 
fifthly the importance and role of small and medium-sized businesses 
mr vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now 
finally the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the structural funds the motives of officials in managing these funds even if it is occasionally complicated and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation follow-up and supervision of the commission 
in relation to this i must inform the european parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year a seminar with national and regional authorities on this question of the evaluation of procedures for the exchange of good practice in the management of structural funds 
i should like to mention a few specific points 
mr berend you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly 
well we are coming to an end of the zoning phase 
you may therefore be satisfied on this point since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by objective 
regarding the informal economy you mention in your report i am well aware that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are dependent on the reliability of data and as mr cocilovo mentioned there is clearly a problem with the reliability of this data 
to a certain extent they are taken into account in the statistics on gdp and labour force surveys and in any case i wish to point out the efforts which eurostat is making and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics 
mr berend you also mentioned as did mr aparicio sánchez the lack of reform in the fisheries sector 
on this point which is of personal interest to me let me remind you that the small scale of this sector and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context 
this type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the directorate general for fisheries under commissioner fischler 
nonetheless i must assure you that the commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which no doubt will respond better to these concerns 
several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion and your rapporteur mentioned some of these 
i wish to assure you firstly that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is as far as i am concerned mr berend an extremely important instrument not only to provide information on what has been achieved in a transparent and rigorous manner so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated but also to create a public debate involving the citizens of europe and furthermore with the elected representatives i.e yourselves on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a european regional planning policy 
in any event i have taken note of your wish to see the following points included in the report the definition compilation and analysis of representative indicators for the region and for all the countries of central and eastern europe a chapter on the islands and most remote regions which several of you mentioned particularly mrs sudre and mr fruteau analyses on the competitiveness of the regions in the countries of central and eastern europe 
this will constitute a great challenge to us all for you and for the commission in the next few years 
and finally there are the cross-border aspects 
i shall endeavour to comply with your recommendations on all these points 
finally i should like to mention a few political conclusions which you are in any case familiar with but whose main elements i should like to reiterate 
ladies and gentlemen considerable progress has been made on the road to real convergence particularly for the four cohesion countries but also frankly mr pohjamo for the objective regions which had suffered some delays in terms of development especially regarding infrastructure 
this is my first point regarding the policy 
my second point regarding the policy is as follows the structural funds have made and continue to make a significant contribution to the convergence process 
all the macroeconomic models we are working on show that over the last decade more than one third of the convergence achieved in the regions whose development is lagging behind would not have taken place without the structural funds 
i have however taken note particularly with regard to the most remote regions mrs sudre mr fruteau and mr nogueira román too that your observation is that there is still much to do and this is my third point regarding the policy in terms of improving employment take-up aspects the fight against social exclusion which is particularly serious and intolerable in many of our regions and the integration of women and young people into the labour market 
now to my fourth point regarding the policy enlargement of the union the great political and humanist project of the coming years for our institutions the major challenge too for the european policy on cohesion a point which mr van dam highlighted 
i shall say that something is already taking shape in berlin and in the financial instruments available to us which may be a policy on cohesion for the first countries who are going to join us 
i am thinking in particular of the pre-accession structural instrument which i shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks 
this sixth periodic report which you assessed as positive on the whole mr berend is a good basis for our thinking for us all and for myself 
i should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period 
thank you very much commissioner 
the debate is closed 
the vote will take place tomorrow at p.m 
are there any comments 
mr president i respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the president of the house to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the minutes 
i refer to item on the order of business 
firstly i believe the issue raised by the president of the socialist group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the president of the commission on the five-year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated 
i wish to express that view even if i respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the president of the socialist group 
the second point i would like to make and which i would have wished to make yesterday before the vote is that this parliament as other speakers remarked yesterday can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the european commission 
we should also have the humility to recognise that if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the president of the commission but also by a five-year programme we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this house so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the commission what our wishes were 
there is one basic lesson i would like us to learn from this 
when there are major set-piece debates scheduled between this house and the european commission in the future we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance 
there needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this house and then between this house and the commission 
we should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships 
looking at some of the press reports of last friday i believe that the commission and its president exercised commendable self-restraint in the way they commented publicly 
that is something for which i have a deep appreciation 
i hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which i believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions 
it should not be dramatised into something more than that 
thank you very much mr cox 
i understand what you are saying 
we have taken note of this 
mr president concerning item of the minutes on the order of business we agreed yesterday to have the bourlanges report on today's agenda 
however it was withdrawn from the committee on budgets last night without being discussed or voted on 
it therefore needs to be withdrawn from today's agenda 
mr wynn that makes sense 
the report is hereby withdrawn from the agenda 
mr president regarding mrs lynne's comments yesterday about health and safety in this building i presume she was talking about the drains because there is a dreadful smell of drains on the fifth floor in the tower 
this needs to be looked into because it is clearly an indication that something is seriously wrong 
i do not want to drag up the issue of this building endlessly but this is a serious problem 
mrs ahern we have taken note of this 
i would ask you to bring this specific case which has to do with the ventilators on a particular floor to the attention of the quaestors who are in fact responsible for the matter 
we will also pass this on to our services however 
thank you very much 
the reactions from experts and persons affected range from complete rejection to unconditional support 
what is this white paper in fact about 
the existing system of european competition rules was set up in the early years of the community 
this system which is based on a centralised application and approvals procedure was certainly appropriate for the conditions prevailing at the time 
this procedure made a substantial contribution to the development of a european competition culture 
however the framework conditions have fundamentally changed in the years since it came into being 
the community of has enlarged to one of and is set to undergo further enlargement to encompass members 
but the system has hardly changed at all 
that is why there is an urgent need for reform and no one takes issue with this in debate 
the commission wants to abolish the application and approvals procedure and enhance the role of national authorities and courts in the implementation of the competition rules 
in other words this would mean a transition from an authorisation system to one of legal exemption 
however the prohibition principle and this is important is to be retained 
in principle i take the view that we ought when an authority accused of tending towards bureaucracy and centralism submits a proposal for debureaucratisation and decentralisation to at least give this serious consideration 
according to the commission's proposal it all revolves around competition-inhibiting agreements between enterprises and abuses of powerful positions 
however the notification obligation with respect to state aid and corporate concentrations is to be retained 
the committee on economic and monetary affairs gave its blessing in principle to these proposals put forward by the commission with only one vote against and two abstentions 
however it will only be possible to form a conclusive assessment once the currently awaited bills produced by the commission are published 
i would like to go into some of these points briefly 
many critics of the white paper maintain that decentralisation will jeopardise the consistent application of community legislation 
not all national authorities in particular the courts are in a position as yet to fulfil the role the commission has in mind for them when it comes to the application of the competition rules 
firstly in the course of the last few decades the national monopolies have familiarised themselves with the implementation of the competition rules to an adequate degree 
nonetheless it is still extremely important for the commission to support the national authorities and courts with group exemption regulations guidelines and notices 
furthermore cooperation between the national authorities and the commission as well as amongst the national authorities themselves must be strengthened 
as far as the competence of the national courts is concerned we recommend in this report that specialised courts be set up for dealing with monopolies law proceedings 
these are already in existence in certain member states and they have proved successful 
entrepreneurs for their part fear a loss of legal certainty 
in order to guard against this the enterprises should in certain cases continue to have the opportunity of being given prior clarification by the commission 
these are only a few albeit central aspects that must be taken into account where the modernisation of the european competition rules is concerned 
that said the process is still very much in its infancy 
discussion will continue until such time as legislative proposals are eventually produced 
however i am convinced of the fact that the white paper has put us on the right path 
a european competition culture has come into being in the course of the last few decades 
the decentralisation proposed by the commission accords with the principle of subsidiarity which has in fact now been firmly established in the treaty 
this leads to increased implementation of the european competition rules at national and regional level thereby making it possible for the european competition culture to be placed on a broader basis 
both the commission and parliament must do more than they have done hitherto to get the message across that competition policy competition between enterprises and the fact that the european commission is supervising this are first and foremost matters which have the interests of the citizens at heart 
however we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter 
but of course both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this white paper 
it is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the european competition policy 
on reading both commission documents one learns that was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in were pursued and even partially completed which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us 
allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture 
as the competent authority the commission with its logically consistent approach has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition not always to the delight of the member states or enterprises concerned 
it should continue along this path 
but commissioner none of this is to become less complicated in future one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the union the deepening of the internal market technological progress globalisation 
only without transparency there will be no acceptance indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency 
the competition report is not a bad foundation for this but in fact there is nothing that could not be further improved upon 
our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought commissioner but there is one point that i would just like to go into now 
transparency and accountability belong together 
i do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the commission and parliament into question 
here too we should continue along the path we have chosen strengthening and intensifying it 
there is one thing i would like to make quite clear though 
parliament is a legislative body but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law of all things is truly scandalous 
therefore i would urge the council and the intergovernmental conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area 
i expect the commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve parliament in doubtful cases even given the treaty status quo 
i also expect the commission to be pro-active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures 
this will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions 
with all due respect for the principle of competition competition is not however an end in itself 
competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions 
at the end of the day one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ideologue 
competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts 
but optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord 
framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses monopolies law being one example 
but on the whole this only serves to prevent abuses framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation 
competition yes restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible 
it is certainly possible indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educating them in regional and environmental policy 
indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition 
this is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible 
it is not just that we should pillory state aid rather our approach must be one of drawing distinctions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above-mentioned objectives 
the commission report is essentially a descriptive report detailing the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors according to various typologies such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued 
let me refer you to the explanatory statement for the quantitative aspects of the report and simply mention at this point that the annual level of state aid on average for the period under review is in the order of eur billion corresponding to a reduction in the order of % in relation to the period a reduction which is essentially due to a reduction in aid in the federal republic of germany 
to put it plainly the level of state aid declared roughly speaking is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately % of community gdp or more or less the equivalent coincidentally of the community budget for one year 
this being the case there are considerable disparities between states which may be measured in various ways such as for example as a percentage of added value and per wage earner 
i think it is also interesting to add state aid and community aid which may be assimilated in some way into state aid 
this clearly shows that it is the four countries which benefit from the cohesion fund among other things which come at the top of the list 
this being the case let me now come to the proposals made in the report 
the commission can only collate and analyse the data provided by the member states 
it is therefore down to the states and regions to ensure the quality of the data provided and our committee considers that additional efforts must be made in this respect 
it is in this spirit that our parliamentary committee for example has championed the longstanding idea of a public register of state aid accessible via the internet 
having better more detailed information available particularly with regard to the objectives pursued and the results recorded must make it possible for the european commission to itself proceed or to commission in a regular manner studies of the social and economic evaluation of national and regional state aid policies 
and insofar as such studies already exist to publish more openly its own comments with regard to the objectives of the treaties which are not only to ensure the competitivity of the european economy but also sustainable development and economic and social cohesion 
by stressing primarily the quality of the information provided our debate in committee and hence the report which it is my honour to present to you avoided a simplistic response in the form of an a priori statement that the level of state aid was in absolute terms either too high or not high enough 
most committee members have sought rather to find a balance between on the one hand the need to see that both states and businesses comply with the competition rules and on the other hand acknowledgement of the value of such aid with a view to contributing to the objectives of the treaty particularly as i have said already as regards sustainable development research and development and economic and social cohesion 
seven amendments have been retabled for this plenary sitting 
most of them are an expression of the political differences among ourselves regarding the appropriateness and effectiveness of state aid in view of the inadequacies acknowledged or not of private investment alone the market failures or inadequacies of the market 
there is in particular one amendment let me point out concerning the energy sector which in my capacity as rapporteur i see as particularly important 
i should like to conclude this presentation commissioner by stressing two things firstly a concern of the members of the committee and secondly a demand of our committee 
the concern involves the pre-accession process for the countries of central and eastern europe in terms of competition policy and state aid 
this is undoubtedly a complex issue and one where we should like to see the commission informing us of the latest development in the matter particularly in terms of the capacity of the economies involved in the accession process to comply with competition rules and as far as state aid is concerned the need in all probability to have specific rules on state aid used to assist restructuring of their sectors 
and finally in conclusion our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the european parliament in the matters we are discussing competition policy and state aid in the context of the intergovernmental conference 
as you know commissioner our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid 
there were a total of cases in and the commission submitted its own report on these 
the ecsc treaty is due to expire shortly 
hence what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future 
according to this article state aid is irreconcilable with the common market in principle 
exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases 
under article the commission is obliged to supervise state aid 
in the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling eur million to the preussag in germany 
furthermore the member states must give the commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid 
the rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on december 
these stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular precisely-defined cases i.e those involving aid for research and development aid for environmental protection social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non-competitive enterprises cease trading altogether 
in addition there is a special provision of up to eur million for greece 
however there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report 
as far as parliament is concerned it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired 
there must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code 
no one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in europe 
this would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years 
we all know that so far the council has dragged its feet with regard to follow-up regulations of this kind 
we therefore demand that once the treaty expires steel aid must be regulated by a council regulation according to article for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity 
this is the only way to enforce the strict ban on all aid not covered by the code 
a council regulation that is directly applicable law must also be observed by the regional governments 
what we need to avoid doing in the future is compromising competition conditions and disturbing the balance in the markets 
the commission will be called upon in a report that has yet to be compiled for the year to give a detailed explanation of its active role in the elaboration of restructuring plans and approved exemptions thus enabling a proper assessment of the overall situation to be made 
once the committee on economic and monetary affairs has adopted the draft report unanimously with two abstentions i would ask that we make full use of this opportunity which we have ourselves created in plenary sitting 
mr president ladies and gentlemen the internal market is not complete 
subsidies monopolies and barriers to competition are still impeding markets and development alike 
national governments provide subsidies and promise that this is the last time but then it happens again 
subsidies distort allocations both within and between countries 
a successive phasing out of state aid is required and more and more markets must be opened up to competition 
this applies to those which have been turned into monopolies both private and public 
public monopolies are more often than not phased out reluctantly 
increased competition and newly established organisations should be able to provide significant benefits in terms of welfare including within the spheres of education health care and social services 
public monopolies must be replaced by competitive structures 
europe must be modernised made more entrepreneurial in spirit and adapted in such a way that it becomes a more competitive environment for consumers and companies 
effective competition pushes prices down and raises standards of living 
it is precisely upon price levels that consumer policy has failed to focus sufficiently 
in fact competition policy and consumer policy belong together 
the internal market is the basis for our work 
its legislation is to apply equally to all to large and small countries alike 
a systematic survey of the various national regulations is needed if barriers to competition are to be dismantled 
the new model now being tested by the commission ought not to lead to a process of nationalisation pure and simple which would undermine the established competition policy 
in order to be effective it must be well anchored in the member states' national authorities 
the question of how best to make further progress has so far been solved through the idea of holding an inter-institutional congress which will open up an unbiased debate adopting a broad perspective and involving representatives of different interests 
this will provide the opportunity to establish new principles or to return to the more radical changes which have been discussed 
there will also be the opportunity to find new common solutions and to analyse amendments from the committee debate 
the law must be correctly applied in matters of competition 
wrongly applied competition policy may cause losses in the legal sphere and interfere with the right of ownership which is an important and basic principle we should stand up for 
we have a quite exciting debate in front of us 
a conference where the issues are properly debated will make it possible to straighten out misunderstandings at the same time as perhaps improving upon certain points 
parliament and the commission can together increase their efforts to achieve an effective competition policy and so create new opportunities and new resources for our citizens 
in fact in my own constituency of stockholm we have many good local examples of increased supply and improved quality which have arisen precisely because of exposure to competition in areas which were previously total monopolies 
we would encourage a continuation of the open debate which has been strengthened in the course of consideration of the reports by mr von wogau and mr rapkay 
we hope that the legal points of view will also be accorded the importance which is only reasonable in a state based on the rule of law 
mr president as a new member i am pleased to be able to make my maiden speech here today even though there has been a delay 
i would like to begin by thanking the rapporteurs mr von wogau mr langen mr rapkay and mr jonckheer as well as the commission for their excellent cooperation 
competition is certainly fundamental to the social market economy and european competition policy is a success story take the energy and telecommunications sectors where there has been a demonstrable lowering of prices and improvement in quality of service 
all this is to the good of the consumer 
but we have now arrived at a point where we need to develop competition policy further 
the commission has put forward a new white paper on this containing two key points dropping the obligation to notify and retrodisplacement of law enforcement 
dropping the obligation to notify will mean less red tape and administration costs at any rate 
at the same time this change of system will also lead to more onus being placed on the individual in the business world of course 
it will no longer simply be a case of submitting papers and having them approved for one thing each person will have to take responsibility themselves and that is probably why there is unease about this in other quarters 
however i believe that we should use this opportunity for europe to set down a marker for less red tape 
the second point relates to the retrodisplacement of law enforcement 
if we are to create a culture of law in europe then there is no doubt that the law must be applied not only by the commission by central bodies but also by national authorities by national courts 
we are not discussing the fact that although every eu law is only ever decided on centrally it is precisely the adaptation phase where we will experience a lack of legal certainty 
it will certainly be necessary to develop an instrument for this in the anticipated legislative procedure that will enable enterprises to enjoy legal certainty and to have recourse to the commission in this matter 
the way to a european monopolies commission must be kept clear something that will certainly form a subject for future discussion 
but we need there to be more transparency in the competition policy 
parliament must have more involvement and i also believe that if we were to introduce a register in which we could ascertain what state aid is being granted then this would encourage the member states to be more disciplined 
however when it comes to what the future holds for competition there are two issues dear to my heart 
one is subsidiarity 
we all hold the view that competition is vital to the economy and requires there to be efficiency and i believe we should also permit competition in the regions 
competition between the regions will certainly strengthen rather than weaken the european union 
i would cite by way of example the issue of job creation schemes savings banks and regional banks and gütesiegel 
here a region has by its own efforts created a means of marketing its own products 
this own initiative must not be destroyed by european intervention 
i believe there is also a need to raise the de minimis regulation 
we should do everything within our power to force the regions into a situation where they have to compete with each other 
my second point relates to discussion about competition and the social market economy although i am not going to talk about market failure just now 
i have already referred to the regional and savings bank sector but i would just like to focus on a matter one hears again and again in certain quarters 
however i could also regard them as a customer and i believe we should enter into rather clear and timely discussion on the ways in which the social field that is evolved structures stifle competition 
apart from that i could refer to any customers any sector as customers and thereby have a highly destructive effect on social fields 
to conclude i would just like to say something on the principle of subsidiarity 
i believe it to be of vital importance that where member states allow regions and local authorities to raise taxes they should continue to be able to do so and not be subject to across- the-board regulation by europe 
thank you very much mr radwan 
i would like to congratulate you on what is referred to in german parliamentary-speak inappropriately in your case as a maiden speech 
mr president commissioner i am speaking on behalf of my fellow member robert goebbels who is unable to attend due to a political commitment 
within the committee on economic and monetary affairs the jonckheer report has given rise to bitter controversy on the subject of the operation of the market 
a slim right-wing majority succeeded in removing any reference to market failures 
even if the majority in this house were to adhere to this ultraliberal idea of a supposedly perfect market it would not make any difference to the real world 
economic relationships in the real world adequately demonstrate that eliminating all public intervention in the market does not in any way bring about perfect competition and the optimum distribution of resources 
while since the dawn of time the market has been the key forum for human interchange it has never been perfect 
the market favours the short term and immediate profits 
on the market the balance of power between supply and demand are generally to the detriment of the weakest parties consumers and workers 
in order to function the market needs rules 
the necessary and valuable spirit of initiative must be offset by a sense of responsibility towards society 
we european socialists are in favour of a market economy with a social purpose 
the market is not an end in itself it must help to improve the human condition 
the european union or individual states must not take over from economic operators but public authorities must define the rules and objectives which enable the economy to develop in a sustainable fashion 
finally aid can enable restructuring offer training save jobs and thus know-how 
this aid must be aligned with the objectives of the union particularly economic and social cohesion sustainable development and research 
the commission must track down the illegal aid and the aid which actually hinders the internal market 
it would be a serious mistake to eliminate all public aid 
the internet is not a product of the market but the result of research financed by the american army 
the world wide web which has enabled the meteoric development of the information society was developed by cern in geneva once again with public aid 
president duisenberg even attempted to attribute the weakness the entirely relative weakness of the euro in relation to the dollar to this state interventionism 
i did not hear mr duisenberg criticising the intervention of the american monetary authorities to save the hedge fund ltcm 
wishing to save jobs is apparently a sin against the market but saving capital does not seem to present any problem for the advocates of the free market 
public monies are used in order to repair the damage caused by international speculation as was the case in mexico asia and brazil 
human labour on the other hand is considered to be a simple factor in the equation 
we socialists reject the liberals' naïve optimism on this point 
we want a true culture of competition in europe 
the state hand must still be clearly seen to regulate the market and the commission must act as judge 
mr president commissioner i want to begin by thanking mr rapkay for a good report and constructive cooperation 
i want to thank you commissioner monti for your outstanding cooperation and i want to tell you that as we enter the new millennium you have an especially important role 
it is your job to tidy up the mess left by national governments 
these may well have grand visions when it comes to competition policy but their capacity to wreak havoc seems boundless 
let me mention the latest examples we have seen holzmann a company which receives considerable aid from the german government sawmills in former east germany and especially aid to shipyards 
these are three areas in which many danish companies are experiencing major problems and are being squeezed out of their markets 
i want to say to mr poos that i very much agree with mr duisenberg that these examples show that some eu member states are not in a position to restructure their economies and to that extent are helping to undermine the value of the euro 
the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party has tabled amendments in the committee all concerning state aid 
these are amendments which we believe will lead to transparency and openness which is very important with a view to making the internal market work 
i should like to take this opportunity to thank my colleagues on the committee for supporting the amendments tabled by the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party 
as i say our amendments concern transparency and i should like to emphasise the amendment which urges the commission to propose uniform criteria and conditions for the type of state aids we consider to be lawful specifically in order to ensure that companies can predict what their situation will be 
another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful 
how do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back 
at present there are no common rules in this area and we vigorously urge the commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on repayment 
this is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition 
finally we propose keeping both a register as mentioned by a number of my fellow meps and also a scoreboard showing where the member states at present stand with regard to state aid 
you have shown us the way mr monti with the single market scoreboard 
it was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid 
i very much hope that you commissioner monti will support these amendments and i look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter 
but as i have already mentioned our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness 
there is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid 
this is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the union and i should like to thank mr jonckheer who in his report has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the applicant countries are able to meet our criteria as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition 
as liberals and greens we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems 
mr president commissioner there are just two questions which must be answered 
are state aid to business or inter-company agreements legitimate in a market economy and who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy 
regarding the first point we say quite clearly that in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the european union has endorsed it is essential that in some instances there is state aid to businesses be it in the form of tax exemptions special taxation or even direct aid 
it is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements 
so our clear response is that yes such aid and such agreements are legitimate but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified 
the von wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level 
we feel this is relatively dangerous but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the commission cannot do everything 
we demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact 
but let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us 
should we not be discussing this issue 
we need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private-sector monopolies 
certain sectors of european industry such as the shipbuilding industry air transport and the steel industry which have been hard hit by existing competition policy have suffered tremendously 
they have lost their status and a significant slice of the world market and hundreds of thousands of workers have been made redundant 
when will we debate that 
the scandalous concentration of power in sectors of strategic importance is giving speculative multinational groups economies the size of entire states and member states of the union at that 
and yet we keep on weakening the public sector and we are ready and willing to tighten competition policy yet further by qualifying public procurement contracts placed with public-sector corporations as state aid 
at the same time unemployment is spiralling as a result of the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs 
workers are facing a massive attack on their employment and social rights 
consumers see their standard of living being eroded poverty spreading and the public sector and production base in most countries in the union being dismantled and dissolved in the name of unadulterated and catastrophic competition in the name of the absolute market economy and the promotion of the monopolistic interests of big business 
we consider the competition policy to be responsible for all this and are totally opposed to it 
mr president commissioner in the course of this pivotal year prior to the changeover to the single currency the commission has deployed every effort to ensure the birth of the euro in a favourable environment 
the competition policy has as far as these resources permitted contributed to this event 
for our part we remain staunchly opposed to the single currency which far from bringing us the advantages and flexibility of a shared currency imprisons us in an artificial straitjacket which has been imposed on the peoples of europe 
having said that governing means planning 
it also means being responsible and in this new context which has been forced upon us competition law naturally has an essential role to play 
in this area the commission has given priority to a number of routes of action acting on the structure of markets by actively combating anti-competitive practices by refocusing its departments' supervisory activities only upon matters with a manifest community interest and by affirming its intention to modernise competition law 
as regards state aid it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex and the introduction of a public register where all aid would be recorded does not seem advisable to us since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints 
finally on the subject of modernising the implementation of articles and of the treaty we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction 
the commission is in fact retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the commission at all 
national states would thus become the secular arm of the commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control 
in conclusion i would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the snowballing of federalism which if it were realised would be to the detriment of europe and the sovereignty of the states 
first of all there is a risk that the decentralisation of powers though necessary in many ways will cause an abnormal increase in competition-related initiatives and that some people will be tempted to use competition law not as a means to be resorted to when all else fails of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the markets but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy planning and interference with the natural workings of the markets themselves or even for protectionist purposes 
in this respect we should heed the words of von eieck and doubtless also those of the great italian liberal bruno leoni who warned precisely against the risks of an abnormal increase in anti-competition policies 
state interference in the economy is even today still to blame for the most serious hindrances placed in the way of the market competition and freedom of choice for european users and consumers 
finally commissioner we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state ranging from state television which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer and the post office to some compulsory insurance schemes including health and social welfare systems which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option 
commissioner i am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the treaties but i believe that it must be emphasised once again that the european economy is finding it hard to compete with the american economy especially because of insufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition 
what is being done may well be very important but it is still not sufficient 
whilst the emu criteria are forcing member states to curb expenditure the high level of state aid to industry has so far remained in place 
this is understandable because it is highly likely that member states which start to cut back on state aid will cause companies to leave with adverse effects on employment 
but at the same time this is not understandable because bad management and non-viable jobs should not be funded by taxpayers' money 
in principle only horizontal regulations are permissible because they do not distort or hardly distort competition 
amendments nos and make reference to the phenomenon of market failure because the market instrument in itself does not result in the ideal society 
vulnerable people find themselves hardest hit 
market forces must be employed in a sophisticated manner to do full justice to the responsibility of citizens and companies 
if this comes to nothing then the government has to step in 
the plea in favour of decentralisation in order to lighten the load within the directorate-general on competition is a kind gesture but the way in which the commission would like to carry this through would lead to the judiciary being stretched 
this would be at the expense of legal certainty within industry 
does the pressure of work within the commission really decrease when national judges are required to report to the commission 
mr president a white paper by definition is not something you can take or leave 
it is there to generate reactions and the white paper has certainly succeeded in doing that 
it forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense 
i understand where the authors are coming from and i share their views 
i also assume that you commissioner want to honour the reputation of and the work put in by your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective 
i cannot imagine the commission taking initiatives in order to de-europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner but i have my concerns and questions nevertheless 
in general i am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market 
the internal market needs a uniform competition policy not only in terms of concept but also in terms of application 
it is true there are some european regulations and interpretative statements on the way 
the commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities 
but i still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward 
so i would like to hear more about how the commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the white paper to be feasible 
secondly i understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty 
many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern 
this instrument will fall by the wayside in future 
in the white paper you state that the commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next 
thirdly i would like to know whether the commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy 
i have particular concerns regarding the fate of smes which will lose part of their legal and financial protection as is already the case one has got to admit within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector 
fourthly i would like to be informed of why the commission does not choose to apply the invalidity penalty in the case of evident infringements of the competition rules 
fifthly with the pending enlargement i wonder whether the candidate counties will be able to play our game 
they are still in training as it were 
what guarantees do we have that they will grow into first-class players in the league of the internal market 
sixthly and lastly i would remind you of a point that i have already raised in my report on vertical restrictions namely the legal privilege of company lawyers 
if the commission implements the white paper objectives it seems to me that discrimination within the internal market and between external and internal legal advisers will become more pronounced and hence even less acceptable 
is the commission considering taking any action to allow in-house lawyers in all member states legal privilege 
commissioner i am asking these questions as a defender of the internal market and i hope that in this sense we are all partners and that the discussion between these partners does not remain sterile but can bear fruit 
mr president i would like in beginning my speech regarding the white paper to congratulate the rapporteur mr von wogau 
the fact that the group of the party of european socialists is very much in agreement with your report is clearly demonstrated by the fact that only one amendment has been presented during this procedure 
we are therefore in agreement with the report commissioner as well as the broad outlines of the white paper 
since the treaty entered into force community law on competition has been one of the tenets of community policy 
after almost forty years of being in force these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion 
for this reason modernisation was essential 
that modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons 
firstly the authorisation system secondly decentralised application thirdly procedural rules fourthly judicial application and fifthly and finally excessive red tape 
the system of individual approvals needed urgent reform as was unanimously requested by specialised companies academics and lawyers 
i have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system 
a system such as the current one which is capable of making so few decisions be they approvals or prohibitions is something less than a valid system 
a reform of this point was therefore also necessary 
the procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in regulation 
the voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous 
the fact that it did not establish a genuine procedure that it did not establish time limits that it did not regulate access for interested parties to the files or that the right to defence was not properly recognised were factors which led to the unanimous demand for reform 
the court of justice accepted some time ago that community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the member states and in the commission published a communication on this subject 
it was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach 
one of the most frequent criticisms of community competition law is its excessive red tape 
as a consequence of the continental legal tradition consideration of whether certain agreements are anti-competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market 
it was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis 
the white paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals 
it is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report 
amongst these firstly is the fact that despite trying to modernise articles and article and not article carries exclusive weight 
at the moment with inter-company agreements and the privatisation of monopolies preserving dominant positions and even consolidating them the combating of abusive conduct is becoming particularly important 
secondly regulation must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation 
for these reasons we are going to vote in favour of the report 
however if some of the amendments are accepted particularly those presented by the ppe-de group we would consider the report to be stripped of its value and to have become an inconsistent document lacking in rigour and in that event we would reconsider our support 
frankly i believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory 
through his management commissioner monti achieves good results as did his predecessor and clearly he has established a guarantee which in parallel with the creation and development of the european internal market has been capable of establishing the corresponding corrective measures so that the market economy within the union may work adequately without the distortions which we economists know may arise when the market is enlarged as has happened in the european union since 
if it functions well if we are satisfied if the commission has basically acted correctly why the need for the modification 
various arguments have been presented in its favour 
mr berenguer made a very accurate analysis justifying the need and the relevant reforms for improving the dynamics of competition but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be applied through the corresponding administrations in the member states are truly identical in all regions 
because if this is not the case we will be faced with the paradox that the commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the european internal market 
in that event we would not have moved forward but rather backwards in the application of competition policy in the union 
mr president i would like firstly to express my appreciation to the commission for the improvement represented by the xxviiith report on competition policy in the union when compared to previous reports 
i would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur mr rapkay who has dissected this dense and comprehensive text in such a concise way 
i would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions such as the basque country which i represent a margin for action by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity 
nevertheless i cannot forget the numerous criticisms both from member states and from market operators which given the broad margin for manoeuvre and discretion enjoyed by the commission in its evaluation of specific cases maintain that they suffer from legal insecurity in the absence of clear rules allowing interested parties to anticipate the position of the authorities and thereby make feasible requests for aid aimed at the promotion of economic activity and employment the planning of company mergers etc 
the only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval through individual cases which will take more than six or eight months to resolve an excessively long period which simply leads to problems of a lack of flexibility affecting the generation of wealth and employment 
i therefore believe that something is missing and i suggest that we establish more regulations lay down clear rules which will benefit all of us businesspeople investors workers and the citizens in general 
mr president i would like to stress that in an age of significant technological changes just look at what is happening in the information technology sector and other sectors such as energy and transport safeguarding competition will be of fundamental importance for our future 
from the point of view of economic growth and therefore of increasing employment and wealth safeguarding a competition policy in the member states is becoming a crucial factor and one that is certainly very important for our future 
this is why i give this report my full support 
recently i have noticed that the commission has been working hard to ensure that this principal is respected in a proper and effective manner precisely in order to safeguard market flexibility both for products and for services 
mr president for british conservatives the efficient and uniform application of european competition policy is at the core of achieving an effective single market across the whole of the european union 
it therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined 
the truth is that the single market is not yet complete 
during my six months as a member of this parliament i have become acutely aware of the determination of many members to drive forward what is described as the european project 
we daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper europe 
but all this in effect is so much rhetoric when we look at the national regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true european single market 
that is the context in which i want to consider the commission's proposals 
i should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for commissioner monti 
we look to him as the man to root out cartels 
but he would recognise that as for everybody else we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination 
that is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the committee for economic and monetary affairs mr von wogau 
i want to congratulate him sadly in his absence for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report and also for putting up with my being such a thorn in his side 
he mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support 
so although i may not share his conclusions i believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the commission must address 
the first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy 
i know that the commission is set against this but the potential exists 
i remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities 
i remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process 
i asked commissioner monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation 
mr von wogau said we can look to the european court 
well we in britain are looking to the european court at the moment 
we find that the european court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with france at the moment in which we have the support of the commission 
unless anybody thinks that this is merely a nationalistic point in the factortame case in which the british government was the defendant it took ten years for the european court to give a ruling 
so judicially something needs to be done 
i ask the commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area 
in relation to legal certainty i endorse the point made by mrs thyssen 
it is important that business has legal certainty 
i mentioned this again to commissioner monti recently 
he said we must not always be carried along by lawyers 
i must declare an interest as a lawyer but also as a former competition minister in the united kingdom 
we all have as it were our histories to live with but it is important that business has legal certainty 
i would also ask the commission whether an analysis has been undertaken of the implications of this change for business a cost-benefit analysis of the sort that is now becoming so much more european policy 
i know there has been an analysis of the implications for the commission of the change 
we have been told how currently people's time is being wasted and that the changes therefore could be beneficial 
but i really feel that in the circumstances we want to know what the implications would be for business 
finally we as british conservatives are looking for a change in direction towards the development of an independent competition authority 
i would like to hear what commissioner monti has to say about that 
it is an integral part of the tension inherent in the very concept of european integration between solidarity and cooperation between member states with a view to creating a better and more efficient environment for the people and the economy and competition which should provide incentives to improve the competitiveness and future viability of the european union as an entity 
it is therefore with some justification that competition policy is one of the most important policies 
we can be proud of a european competition culture for it is this that will make the social market economy a reality 
we can be proud of monopolies and mergers supervision 
however we must be vigilant in the face of global operators against whom nation-states are no longer able to impose limits 
society is surrendering itself to the economy 
that is precisely what we do not want in the european union 
we are aware that in this age of strategic alliances and millennium mergers in usd billion was paid out in connection with take-overs restrictive practices are being held in check not just by our own rules but also by bilateral cooperation with the usa or japan or others until we get the international competition law we so badly need 
european competition policy as we very often forget is not just important for fair competition as such but also for prices growth and employment and hence for the public 
in common with the other members i call for parliament to have codecision rights where competition law is concerned 
it is essential that this long overdue step be taken 
it is also important to underline the connection between competition policy and consumer protection 
i welcome the fact that commissioner monti wants to make progress in this area in the dialogue with the european parliament as he does in the dialogue with non-governmental organisations consumer protection associations and the public 
greater transparency will also help to achieve public acceptance of decisions relating to competition policy 
then it is possible to understand that for example lower electricity and telecommunications prices are due to european competition policy and brussels should not be pilloried when aid decisions are taken which are of course bound to cause problems at a particular moment in time or in a local context 
it is particularly important for there to be clarity in relation to competition rules in view of eu enlargement 
emphasis must also be placed on the fact that a state aid policy and the jonckheer report makes this very clear must continue to afford each state the freedom to define and organise the tasks of the public sector and ownership structures on an independent basis 
at the same time it must be made clear that aid can serve a useful purpose with a view to offsetting the deficiencies of the market and furthering community objectives 
a word on the white paper the revision of articles and represents a change of direction in monopolies policy 
i am opposed to this unlike the majority of this house and indeed the majority of my own group because i believe that in competition policy terms the directly applicable exception system is in every sense inferior to a system of prohibition unless certain conditions are met and i believe there is a threat of renationalisation 
the system currently in force creates transparency affords enterprises legal certainty and has without a shadow of a doubt led to discipline and acted as a deterrent on account of the notification requirement 
the problem of overwork highlighted by the commission is not a sufficient reason for making radical changes to the legal system 
indeed it is debatable whether this could be carried through at all without amending the treaty 
mr president i am very glad that mrs randzio-plath mentioned the very important context of our debate because up until now no other speaker has done so 
the advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within european business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions 
for example the figures for last year now show that the total value of mergers in the european area was eur trillion which is seven times the level of merger activity at the peak of the last european merger boom in 
this poses enormous challenges for competition policy which i hope it will be able to meet because for certain many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale 
commissioner monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the eldr group are that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive practices 
delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what mr von wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no slippage in the european element and particularly would ask the commissioner to reassure us that there would be random checks on that 
mr president in the limited time i have i would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteurs and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here in particular by mr jonckheer who criticised the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio-economic balance in the granting of aid 
i also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of article especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration 
as a member for the basque country i would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fair competition in the market 
i say this in case there is any doubt about the criticisms which we have directed at the commission in general and mr monti in particular for its persecution of the incentives to basque companies and the fact that it considers them to be state aid 
our discrepancy stems from the fact that the commission continues to misunderstand the character of the general system and the co-responsibility of our arrangement which gives our basque fiscal rules the same nature foundation and aim as the rules of the member states of the union and that they are applied in a general way to all tax-payers who by virtue of points which fall under an external system of law are subject to those rules 
mr president commissioner competition is exactly what we need 
we need competition if there is the least unemployment for a smooth-running healthcare system for social justice for high social standards and of course we also need these are competition criteria to do with the economy business management competition so as to achieve highest-quality products equal market access conditions for all enterprises and environmentally-friendly products 
in other words we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics 
i often have the impression unlike the country i come from former east germany where economic competitiveness is prized above all else and competitiveness relating to managerial economics is disregarded that very often the reverse is the case society thinks almost exclusively in terms of managerial economics 
i say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this 
but a system cannot function in this way it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand 
i will give you an example the european union was right to support the grönitz steelworks in brandenburg although out of jobs only remained 
but these are competitive jobs for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the federal republic of germany 
if we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics 
to that end we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply 
mr president ever since i was elected to this parliament in i have never witnessed a report which had such anti-irish sentiments and overtones as the jonckheer report which we are debating today 
i would like to quote verbatim from the report state aid per capita is highest in italy germany and ireland 
ireland clearly is in the lead when national and community regional and social funds are put together 
i believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures 
i find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation 
i should like to remind the member that the european union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period plus 
this was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within europe 
regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper 
i welcome the fact that grant aid of % and a top-up of % for smes for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in objective regions in europe 
i remind mr jonckheer that irish companies or foreign companies in ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland european marketplace 
no other member state is at such a disadvantage 
mr president the monopolies' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in europe 
the commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies' ban to be unsatisfactory something i would wholeheartedly agree with 
but opinion differs as to the solution 
in other words we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse 
both i and other meps utterly reject such a drastic change of system 
i do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law 
we would be changing the law to make it executable again which is something i consider to be unacceptable 
the commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions 
the requirement to lodge applications in brussels will be dropped in other words the commission will be completely in the dark in future 
this is unacceptable to my mind 
but if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a patchwork quilt of competition policy 
this is unacceptable in my view 
it would weaken a key element of european policy 
the change of system in european monopolies law that the european commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned 
there are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition 
there was no majority for this at the time 
since france laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy 
i consider this to be unacceptable 
as the court of justice recognised in the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition-related disturbances 
indeed several years ago this was the conclusion of a report that i compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the european steel sector 
this is why it was justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses even if this was in contradiction of article of the ecsc treaty 
this indeed is the aim of the sixth steel aid code but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets hence the importance of regulating such aid 
it is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research development environmental protection and cases of company closure 
in the same category of ideas it is essential that member states fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the commission for the aid granted to their steel companies 
the commission suggests shorter deadlines 
i agree with this request 
like the rapporteur while i am pleased with the commission report nonetheless i deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid 
although the steel aid code is expressed in a very clear way the commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipulated by the code 
in the interests of equality either the code must be applied or it must be modified 
finally and in conclusion mr president with the expiry of the ecsc treaty the regulations will have to be reviewed since i think that the aid system will have to continue beyond and in that case i am in favour of a council regulation which will ensure security in this area 
mr president i am also going to refer to the report by mr langen which concerns aid to the steel industry 
i agree with the rapporteur on two issues 
firstly i agree on the need to guarantee equal conditions for aid to all member states and secondly on the need for transparency with regard to this aid 
we agree with the rapporteur regarding his criticism of the fact that despite the rules laid down in the sixth steel aid code the commission has frequently authorised aid to companies which do not correspond to the categories in that code 
however the thing that worries us most mr president is the decrease in prices by % owing to imports 
the reason for this decrease is unfair competition from south korea and taiwan in the case of steel as a result of their different working conditions and conditions governing aid 
orders in the steel industry and the ship-building industry we also spoke about this a while ago have decreased drastically resulting in a loss of jobs 
i live in a region where the ship-building industry now has very serious problems asturias 
with global markets we need global employment laws and global subsidies 
i know this is difficult to achieve now but if we do not achieve fair employment laws for all workers here and elsewhere and we do not secure equitable subsidies for all countries here and elsewhere it will be difficult to preserve jobs in europe and outside it 
i congratulate the rapporteur karl von wogau who takes up the theme but also makes quite plain his demand for clarification indicates the accompanying measures that need to be taken and pulls no punches when it comes to the problems currently under discussion 
the white paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection discussion and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves the judiciary the member states and above all the smes concerned that need to be clarified 
competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be renationalised because this would jeopardise the internal market and europe as a business location in a global economy 
however it must be europeanised taking into account the principle of subsidiarity 
i also welcome therefore the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual without the commission giving up any of its responsibility 
to conclude i would like to tell you what i am expecting from this reform fair competition and equal competition conditions legal certainty for all enterprises consistent application of competition policy procedural simplification according to the principle of the one-stop-shop coordination of the national and to me independent competition authorities close cooperation between the national authorities and courts and the commission along with a clear distribution of competences between national authorities and courts in the application of european competition and monopolies law and i expect the commission to concentrate on what is most crucial in the fulfilment of its tasks as the supreme guardian of the european competition policies 
i am in suspense as to how the discussions which were broadly based will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal 
the commission report confirms that with the exception of germany state aid to businesses is increasing 
the commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition 
as far as we are concerned we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes 
society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business 
take for example the car manufacturing sector where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by % during the reference period 
with what aim 
not to save jobs 
all these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies 
not to improve working conditions for in increasing production with fewer workers working conditions are made worse 
did these firms need state aid to survive 
no car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years 
state aid is not only counterproductive because as the jonckheer report acknowledges it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relocating from one country to another but it is unacceptable because it allocates public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders 
it is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout europe social protection is being reduced public services are being abandoned hospitals are being closed 
in voting against the jonckheer report i wish to assert the need for another policy to wit ceasing all aid to private firms and utilising the money thereby saved to develop public services and recruit staff 
in accordance with the principle of competition the legislation has implemented articles to competition policy in the strict sense and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition 
firstly fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently thanks to commissioner monti there have been direct provisions the code of good conduct in particular 
in this respect i have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions 
firstly it is necessary in drawing up the legislation to produce clear and complete rules 
it is probably horrendous especially in this particular raft of legislation that there are confused rules regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay down undefined legal concepts 
this is all the worse as is the case with the second part of this reform when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities 
thirdly it seems to me important that the commission should play a role in resisting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the commission in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies 
fourthly and lastly and this has already been mentioned the international legal order has changed 
we have seen this in the aborted seattle conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world 
the principle of competition must now be universal in its application 
we must monitor compliance with environmental standards employment standards in order to prevent dumping in this area and we must ensure scrupulous respect for property rights and the revision of state aid which in many industries as has already been said distorts competition and destroys jobs within our own territory 
to sum up we should apply similar conditions that will prevent aid internal distortions by other countries from being transferred to the international arena in other words through trickery 
for example the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from member state to member state reveals the need for surveys such as this 
the form the aid takes is important 
forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported 
for example state guarantees on which the commission has just publicised its position must naturally be considered state aid but they are in my opinion a better option than granting aid directly to companies 
the european economy will never achieve the level of competitiveness desired if we do not show we trust in the markets 
if competition policy is to be made subordinate to the aims of social and environmental policy real efficiency and economic growth will remain just a dream 
competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non-material rights we should not just be emphasising its social dimension 
the aims of social policy can be best realised through stronger economic growth not by making compromises with regard to decisions on competition policy 
in my opinion it would be good if we could achieve consensus at the international level regarding certain basic principles of competition law 
aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator which will water down all the aims of competition policy 
i would like to thank the rapporteur mr von wogau for his commitment and i welcome his thoughts 
moreover i would like to say that i appreciate the remarks and observations that professor tesauro chairman of the italian competition authority sent me and which i am sure mr monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration 
our real concern is undoubtedly to initiate further liberalisation of the market and above all to achieve consistency between the different national markets 
as things stand there are considerable differences between them which come to the fore if we compare the english italian and french markets 
there is a large degree of state protectionism in the french market which is not found in the english market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in italy 
another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment 
in my opinion we should also create a threshold below which two significant components which characterise our economic structure should be placed small and medium-sized businesses which bind the european economy together and social protection which europe has always guaranteed to the weakest parts of the economy 
a point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands all of which must be protected 
we ought therefore to consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with russia and the mediterranean countries precisely so that their economies become less peripheral 
i hope and i thank mr monti for this that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed 
mr president competition is at the heart of the european internal market policy and is also its driving force 
a free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition marked by clear uniform rules 
in his report karl von wogau manages to capture this very well 
but europe is changing 
the economies are growing we are enlarging to member states 
the european commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy 
it is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy 
this is not in question 
having said this i still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation 
how will the commission as keeper of the treaties guarantee that decisions are taken uniformly in matters of competition in london palermo helsinki and soon budapest and ankara 
this is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented and issues of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgements are given 
it is not enough to say that in the member states there is already years' worth of experience 
in the netherlands the competition authority is still in its infancy 
this country has a very small market which unfortunately is often at the same time defined as the relevant market 
this in contrast to germany where a very experienced kartellamt is exercising its powers within a gigantic market 
uniformity needs to be worked on 
think of specialist national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the european court 
this special court in luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise 
moreover due to the immense economic and social interests involved we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event as is now quite normal 
i would like to finish off by making an important point for small and medium-sized businesses 
in order to grant small and medium-sized companies greater security the european commission itself needs to draw up an exemption regulation for small and medium-sized businesses so that alongside vertical exemptions horizontal exemptions will also be possible 
through cooperation small independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains 
it cannot be the aim of european competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses 
mr president being the last to speak gives me the privilege commissioner of telling you that the majority of this house supports your initiative and has expressed a total and i believe justified confidence in you at the helm of this boat 
but we all want to be oarsmen on it 
we all belong on the same boat and want to row with you 
i therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing touches to this essential reform 
the many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories 
firstly there is the concern that some have expressed in particular mrs randzio-plath president of the committee on economic affairs of whether this new system of legal exception is absolutely compatible with the treaty 
i share that concern and i believe that this issue should be addressed 
secondly we have the issue of companies' legal certainty 
it is true commissioner that the commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty 
we all agree on this 
but it is nonetheless true and this has been repeated from all sections of this house that the european industrial fabric is composed of small and medium-sized businesses and that the commission often plays the role of auctoritas of legitimising the nature of the internal market 
on this point i will give my opinion on something which mr karas said 
there have only been nine rejections 
but here i would like to call on my experience as a lawyer 
how often has a lawyer with two companies and one project in the face of a commission guideline given ex ante changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules 
this is therefore an aspect to be considered 
thirdly we have the problem of the uniform application of community law 
in this respect the excellent speech by mrs thyssen cannot be improved upon 
i believe that biodiversity is good as is cultural diversity but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market that is to say competition law 
here improvements should be made 
only in certain countries germany for example is there specialised jurisdiction 
perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore but we must also explore others 
what we cannot do commissioner and i would like to end on this note is to give way and give ammunition to those who regard the european institutions as the property of the great and the good of the rich and not of the citizen or the small and medium business which in the worst case scenario which will never become reality because the requisite measures will be applied to prevent it will result in courts which make disparate judgements very late with no real possibility of control apart from what the french call le parcours du combatant that is to say after lord knows how many years when the court in luxembourg passes judgement a court which we know to be inundated at the moment 
commissioner it is impossible to overstate the importance of this reform 
it transcends competition it transcends the cohesion of the internal market 
i believe that it profoundly affects the meaning of european integration the meaning of the legitimacy of european integration 
therefore commissioner we are relying on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the finishing touches to a reform which we are all hoping for and which we believe will lead us to a successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation 
mr president ladies and gentlemen i heartily congratulate the committee on economic and monetary affairs and the entire european parliament for the great deal of interest shown in competition-related subjects 
in my opinion mr president this joint debate fully bears this out 
we have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order 
our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy a pillar of the social market economy and of european construction 
the guiding thread running through all the aspects of the reform of competition policy which we shall have the opportunity to address together aims to ensure more effective protection of competition reduce the bureaucratic burden weighing down businesses and take decision-making processes closer to the european people 
i personally would sincerely like to thank mr von wogau for his commitment in examining the dossier on the white paper and for the quality of his report 
i would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von wogau report into four groups 
i do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the commission but on the contrary fundamental contributions since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome 
the groups are the efficiency of the rules the risk of renationalisation consistent application of the rules and legal certainty 
i will take these very quickly one at a time 
efficiency i am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it 
the current notification instrument ladies and gentlemen no longer allows us to reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the commission is properly informed about the most serious restrictions i would remind you that in years there have only been nine cases in which the commission has decided on prohibition following notification in the absence of a complaint nor does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for businesses which in the majority of cases receive a simple comfort letter 
the proposed system will improve the protection of competition primarily because it will allow the commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in stamping out infringements and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals 
the question of renationalisation first of all although it is not really necessary i would like to point out and stress several times if i may that the white paper does not affect mergers or state aid in the slightest we are not looking for devolution in these areas but that as far as regulation is concerned there is a risk of renationalisation 
of course we have pondered this issue and we are still studying it extremely carefully and this is also thanks to the concerns you have voiced 
at the end of the day i honestly do not believe that this fear is justified 
the commission proposal accords the commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy 
the reform will lead to a gradual development i stress this because i was particularly taken with this term used by mrs randzio-plath and moreover i fully agree with it of european competition culture 
so the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplanted and taking root in the european competition culture where today various small plants thrive and they are certainly not all the same 
the fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned permitting greater use of community law which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply 
allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation not renationalisation of competition law 
the question of consistent application the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind but i do not believe that it should be exaggerated 
in a directly applicable exception system consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules 
the commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework both through general provisions and through its decision-making practice 
secondly we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes and the white paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation 
in this respect i would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by mrs riis-jørgensen and mr huhne of monitoring implementation 
this then is the idea of monitoring implementation 
i must say that i find this a very good idea that we will probably take up 
though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on it is evident that we will watch very carefully how ec law is applied by national authorities and courts 
that is why the commission wants to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application 
this goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns mrs peijs 
concerning mr evans' point regarding the implications for businesses it is important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conducted 
the purpose of publishing the white paper is after all to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources 
we have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business 
we will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation 
there is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance 
this was raised by mrs thyssen mrs peijs and mrs palacio vallelersundi the issue of smes 
many speakers have underlined this 
the commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for smes 
we are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for smes 
why 
is this simply a political gesture 
no 
in the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most smes will be covered by block exemption regulations as in the field of vertical restraints 
most smes have in fact less than % of the market share 
the fourth group is legal certainty 
mr evans legal certainty is of course and i am the first to acknowledge this important for businesses not just for the legal professions although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of europe 
legal certainty is important for businesses this is a subject the importance of which the chair of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market mrs palacio vallelersundi emphasised in her last intervention and i am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market including in this case competition 
let me simply remind you that the court of justice pronounced a ruling on this in as you know better than i this ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof 
the white paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be re-examined the exchange of confidential information 
the guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion 
we share the same basic views but the rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully 
i will mention only two in order to be brief 
the first is greater transparency 
parliament knows how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy as i did right from the moment i had my hearing on september in the committee on economic and monetary affairs 
as regards the international aspect of competition policy i can confirm mr rapkay that the commission is willing to provide parliament with a report on this subject to which mrs randzio-plath has also drawn our attention 
we have very satisfactory bilateral relations with the relevant american canadian and japanese authorities as regards competition policy and we are working to ensure that competition is treated as a separate topic within the world trade organisation 
mr jonckheer i would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the seventh survey on state aid in the european union 
i will not talk about codecision here but this certainly does not mean i do not consider it important 
it has major institutional implications which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition i am therefore not qualified to give an opinion and this is obviously a matter for the broader context of the intergovernmental conference 
i am awaiting with great interest the results of the eighth survey which according to the scheduled timeframe should be being drawn up by the staff now in january and for adoption by the commission in march to see whether the latest trends are confirmed 
mr jonckheer mrs thyssen and mr gemelli raised the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of state aid 
i can only say very briefly that we are actively working with them on a practical level they are making preparations they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities 
i can also say in respect of your concerns on energy and especially on the environment which as you know i share that we are concluding the review of the organisation of environmental state aid 
in connection with the issue of state aid i would also like to take up one of the points raised by mrs riis-jørgensen among others regarding repayment of illegal aid 
in april the commission adopted new rules of procedure which introduced specific rules on repayment 
in the near future and i can assure you of this you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rules 
finally mr president i would like to thank mr langen warmly for his report which although geared more towards a specific sector is a valuable contribution 
i would like to say that as we know the commission report on state aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure pursuant to article of the ecsc treaty but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector 
in respect of future provisions on aid for the steel sector which will come into force in july we will ensure that strict discipline continues to be applied and the industry itself now agrees on the need for this 
when we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form i will be happy to present our viewpoint to you 
i am especially grateful for all of this 
we will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the committee for economic and monetary affairs and at a more general level with parliament 
in this regard i liked your term mrs palacio vallelersundi we must all pull together preferably in the same direction 
competition is not an end in itself as mr rapkay rightly pointed out but it plays an extremely important role in european integration 
as mr von wogau said at the start of the debate at the end of the day competition is not an abstract concept it is in the public interest and forms the basis of the social market economy 
i would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social as well as economic role in the european integration process as it has done in the past 
thank you commissioner monti 
the joint debate is closed 
the vote will take place tomorrow at p.m 
mr president year after year we learn mainly from the european court of auditors' test reports that money is lost to the budget of the european union on account of misdemeanours ranging from wastage mismanagement and irregularities to suspected blatant fraud 
particular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud to detecting it punishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening 
creating uclaf by means of the task force and setting up the anti-fraud office olaf were important steps as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the community and on local monitoring 
the union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed 
so far efforts on the part of the commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success 
it is for the member states to undertake criminal measures 
since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross-border violations against the union budget are on the increase they are also committed by those involved in organised crime it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the member states 
then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual member states together with protracted or even unfulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement 
what is more the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the european council in did nothing to change this 
for it to enter into force it must be ratified by all member states 
after five years only four have done so 
there is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority rather the aim is to equip the union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity 
we are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised 
the concerns of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market as articulated in its position together with those of the committee on citizens' freedoms and rights justice and home affairs will also be taken full account of in this process 
we would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of olaf and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency transparency and the protection of the rights of individuals 
i support the proposed deadline for the commission being september in a proposed amendment 
the second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings 
the commission ought and i have also amended this deadline to may to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the commission for coordinating and supervising the legal investigative body olaf 
the existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the director of the agency 
there is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the member states 
the court of justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts 
further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called five wise men 
the commission mr barnier mr vitorino and several member states are equally receptive to the idea 
i call upon you ladies and gentlemen to vote in favour of this report which the committee on budgetary control adopted with a large majority 
we can set another example here to the effect that parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular fraud and to mete out punishment where necessary 
mr president i am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and i congratulate mrs theato 
i believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well and the result which we have received today is moderate and thoughtful in a very delicate area 
if we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand least clear and most confused however you like to put it the competition would be very hard fought 
the treaty is a collection of complex articles 
however this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize 
we are all aware and this parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect of the need to protect the financial interests of the community 
but be careful 
the conclusions of the theato report safeguard them perfectly 
therefore in my capacity as president of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market and of course as an mep i hope that a large majority of this house will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the commission 
mr president this as mrs theato said is a critical report 
it is a report that has been proposed by the committee on budgetary control and it is an own-initiative report 
one of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because whether we like it or not the european union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement 
it is sometimes exaggerated but there it is 
we need to do something about it 
some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the member states and let us not forget that the member states are responsible for implementing about % of the eu budget 
a lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the convention on the protection of financial interests and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done 
we need to take this responsibility seriously 
we need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the european union 
the question is who prosecutes 
that is where we really get into difficulty 
whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers 
we need also to be sensitive to the concerns of member states 
the proposal to set up a european public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one 
we are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a european judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people 
but the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the igc to start discussions 
of most importance to parliament as the guardian of the budget of the european union is how to deal with people who work within the european union institutions 
at a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal 
people need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted and that is not the case at the moment 
the whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by mrs palacio 
i should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the commission should tackle this question 
we are aware that it is a delicate debate 
we know that the commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties 
can i just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here no commitment to a federal european public prosecutor 
but there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable 
mr president i would like to start by congratulating mrs theato on her report 
i think it is a first-class report which will for the most part be supported by my group 
i just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage 
judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months this could well be the case 
but the member states failed to cooperate 
this is just a political fact about which little can be done at present i think 
it is now possible on the basis of article of the treaty that the commission will take new initiatives and i would like to suggest to the commission that it do this at the earliest opportunity 
unlike the previous speaker who has now disappeared my group is strongly in favour of a european public prosecutor 
my colleague jan-kees wiebenga will undoubtedly take this point further because he has already published a report on the same subject matter 
i think what we need is at european level to come up with exact definitions of fraud and irregularity as quickly as possible 
i myself have been involved in the committee of inquiry on transit traffic 
one of the major problems in this area was that if you do something wrong especially when it comes to revenue of the european union then this will be termed an irregularity in one country and a crime in another 
this i thought is no longer permissible certainly not at the moment 
i would like to make one general point on politics 
whatever we may say about the european elections the low turnout is a fact 
we can improve on this by punishing crime in europe quickly and this must be done at european level 
mr president i too would like to thank the rapporteur 
i believe that is something we are all desperately in need of bearing in mind the results of the last european elections and of the level of turnout 
yet every year we have the same problem 
the court of auditors publishes its report which criticises the member states on account of various incidences of fraud 
so far however the european institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied 
it is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year 
it is important that after the first step which has already been taken i.e forming olaf from uclaf an independent institution we now take the second step and create a legal framework for olaf in order that olaf too might operate within a secure legal framework 
having said all that i must say that unfortunately my group will not be voting for your report as a united front 
i hope that the debate will convince a few more people 
unfortunately however people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of european institution that undermines subsidiarity 
indeed we are talking about criminal law the area where resistance that national states put up to communitisation is and will be fierce 
indeed it is unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector that of the protection of financial interests without first having created a european legal system 
reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are 
in any case this idea must be encouraged and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a community corpus iuris in the treaties 
on behalf of my group but also personally i hope that the vital financial spirit of the union will pave the way for the creation of a european legal system which respects citizens' rights and guarantees which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto unseen in many states 
therefore on behalf of my group i would like to say that we support the theato report i nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the igc agenda 
this proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state 
but the idea of a european public prosecutor on the other hand aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters 
moreover this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms 
according to the theato report the european public prosecutor is needed in particular in order to better support the inquiries of the anti-fraud office olaf 
at the same time however we see from the van hulten report under discussion today that the european public prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a european union court 
in this way a small european reform may hide a medium-sized one and a medium-sized one may hide a large one 
not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a european criminal law and then why not a european minister of justice supervised by an extension of the powers of the european parliament 
i therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put forward this type of reform which appears to be quite specific 
in the final analysis we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a european public prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of a europe in anything other than a centralised and hierarchical form organised around a superstate 
the union for a europe of nations group on the other hand wishes to see a polycentric europe with nations linked in a network 
and such a network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosecution authorities for example and the creation if necessary of national teams specialising in offences involving community finances 
so the legal framework mr president is already in place 
it is fine in principle 
it need only be fine-tuned 
mr president mrs theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason 
public opinion although indifferent to million unemployed and thousands of mad cows is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endangering financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a twofold solution a european criminal code with crimes against the community and a european prosecutor-general 
mrs theato probably forgot to include a european prison now that we have the fbi the european police in the form of olaf 
all this would be established by two regulations one for the public prosecutor and another for the criminal code 
the regulations would be adopted pursuant to article of the treaty i.e based on secondary law whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible 
and indeed there is a twofold shift 
firstly the classic eurofederalist ideological shift a single market a single vat a single diplomatic service a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor 
all this to combat fraud worth less than eur billion while disregarding the tens of billions of euros lost due to the generalised system of preferences free trade areas customs presents to chiquita and the billions lost to the fourth resource gdp as a result of the budgetary rationing pact 
next we have the puritan shift the teutonic europe of the north the europe of the lutherans calvinists and quakers wishes to inflict its moral order on us 
basically the more we lose our grip on morals the more we tighten our grip on our wallet 
mr president it is essential for there to be effective protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the european union more so these days than there used to be 
the credibility of the efforts we make here in parliament to employ our finances properly stands and falls with the efforts we make to deal with such scandals and prevent them from arising in the future 
this does not just mean administrative changes but also structural changes in other words we must create instruments which are actually capable of affording protection under criminal law 
the intergovernmental conference will provide the appropriate forum for discussing this 
now it is of course possible to take the view that criminal law and criminal proceedings law are intrinsically matters pertaining to the law of the member states and it is quite unthinkable that they should be governed by the principle of subsidiarity 
there is no doubt that i myself am one of the advocates of this principle and one of those who oppose any further extension of competences at european level 
when it comes to the demands made on the intergovernmental conference agenda it is the call for there to be clear delimitation of competences that should take centre stage 
the compatibility with the various national systems of law as confirmed by experts shows that criminal law is another area where europe has a great deal in common for example where the significance of the offences we have been discussing here is concerned 
taking these aspects into account i consider it appropriate that we create a framework of this kind as proposed and i also consider it necessary to the further development of olaf 
mr president will a european public prosecutor be able to abolish football fraud involving eu funds 
i do not believe so 
on the other hand we can go a long way using the existing tools 
an alternative to the european public prosecutor could be eurojust as proposed at the last summit 
in the way it is structured eurojust should correspond to europol and support investigations into crimes 
it is just such practical cooperation there is a need for 
olaf europol and the treaty on extradition and mutual assistance in criminal matters should be used fully and when the fraud convention from is at long last ratified in the member states we can also achieve a lot with this 
i nonetheless agree with the rapporteur that it is quite unacceptable that most member states should still not have ratified this agreement 
however it would be quite a mammoth task to establish such an office 
it is after all only the most serious crimes which would have consequences under criminal law 
ninety per cent of cases would be disciplinary matters concerning negligence or incompetence 
instead there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily 
we should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and especially change our practice 
at the moment article of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used 
should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we plunge into constructing grand new institutions 
mr president we all want to do something about combating european fraud 
but the question is now is the european union doing anything about it as well 
the answer to this is that we know very little about this 
the tampere summit was about combating crime 
everyone was supposedly pleased about it but in reality we have made little progress 
there is no european anti-fraud legislation in force because the member states as was stated before have not ratified the treaty texts submitted 
so a great deal has to be done in this area 
and what exactly should be done 
firstly the same penalty clauses regarding european fraud must apply in all member states of the european union 
so unification in this small area 
i feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on 
it is in fact something very positive 
just like europol 
europol involving police cooperation does not rank above the national police forces but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces 
parliament supports this 
the committee of wise men supports this 
i urge the council of ministers and the european commission to do the same 
mr president i want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris 
i would very much like to support what mrs morgan said on this issue 
corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation 
the idea of a european public prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout eu territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in ireland and the uk 
the idea of a single criminal code and the european public prosecutor is something which member states have a right to be informed about 
indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the eu budget 
but when corpus juris was actually launched in in san sebastian to a very select audience of jurists with no media invited the president of the european parliament at the time mr gil-robles gil-delgado said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend eu competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity 
we need a public debate on this 
we need the member states and the citizens in the member states to be properly informed 
the issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in ireland and the uk needs to be addressed 
there needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date 
it is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the member states of the eu without any proper public debate 
mr president on behalf of the italian radical members i abstained on this text in the committee on budgetary control because i share the concerns that have been voiced in such an authoritative way by the representative of another legal culture which is certainly important common law 
with this text we are undoubtedly forcing the issue since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for community fraud to be curbed to be crushed 
nevertheless the way in which our committee intends to see this text through with the drive and stubborn desire of its chair mrs theato will not be without its critics 
another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law 
article of the treaty allows the council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud 
nevertheless we are left feeling slightly perplexed that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this 
that is to say they are neglecting the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system 
we wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee 
mr president we need to speak our minds on this subject in the european parliament during the plenary sittings and in the committees even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed 
we find ourselves dealing with some very serious events which in the past seemed to be the norm 
for this reason it is right to look at the issue of safeguarding common interests and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual states 
in this respect we are faced with the most sensitive issue what role would a european public prosecutor play in relations with the individual national communities and their domestic legal systems 
this issue needs to be explored further in both cultural and practical terms 
today we run the risk of adding a new institution to the already numerous and varied institutions which exist within each country 
mr president i would very much just like to add to two particular points 
firstly i would not wish to take up the philosophical issues of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of member states although i am very much in favour of having such a debate for my regular viewing of british television programmes has shown me what the national politicians are conjuring up there in the way of threats posed by the continent to the home-grown legal system 
sometimes it is worthy of satire and merits discussion but i digress 
i believe that as far as the judicial difficulties are concerned that we are facing here and the european union evidently has only very limited room for manoeuvre when it comes to making these offences litigable as european criminal offences we have become embroiled in legalities 
i am referring to recommendations and 
after all there is no longer mention of a european public prosecutor rather for legal reasons it has now become an independent european authority or body to quote mrs theato 
we obviously have difficulties there with regard to the legal basis 
we also face difficulties with regard to offences 
nothing has changed there 
as has always been the case there are offences that transcend european offences as it were or at least there is the potential for them to do so and these might include money-laundering receiving stolen goods and forming a criminal organisation 
as far as that is concerned i believe there are judicial uncertainties that need to be overcome 
what parliament needs to do as a matter of urgency though and this is why we intend to vote for recital without these recommendations is to send out a clear political signal to the commission and council that we want to see a clear legislative act put an end to this disorderly state of affairs 
on the other hand more pro-active attempts such as olaf which is currently operating have not allayed legitimate concerns about the system of guarantees for individual rights 
these proposals represent a serious attempt to establish a new and ever more urgently-needed uniform criminal law for the whole community 
at the same time they call for the existence of an independent body to coordinate and monitor the thoroughness of investigations by olaf without harming the administration of justice by each member state and under the supervision of the european court of justice 
finally following on from what was agreed in tampere the report restates the need for a european public prosecutor 
nevertheless it raises some very basic questions 
is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justifying in legal terms the creation of a specifically community-wide criminal law which although it might be called subsidiary will always clash with the practice and in certain areas with the traditional separate criminal law of the member states 
surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom security and justice 
mr president the eu is now exposed to tough scrutiny 
confidence in the european union has been seriously damaged 
to remedy this vigorous efforts are required 
we therefore welcome increased resources for olaf so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently 
at the same time we think it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the eu must be able to be held accountable in an effective way 
we therefore think it only right that the commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing the further development of the already existing legal framework 
on the other hand i am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common european legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime 
in the present situation i am therefore sceptical about the idea of a european prosecutor which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty 
we have more confidence in eurojust where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate 
the major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the union but rather that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered 
the challenge for the commission and for ourselves is however to find the right mix 
the mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which through an exaggerated supervision of detail prevents the development of a modern administration 
the main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision 
our experience of modern administration tells us that openness decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision 
the major challenge is therefore to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law 
this requires staff training more modern recruitment methods and above all openness and public control 
being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities 
mr president rapporteur restoring the confidence of the citizens in the work of the european institutions and in european politics is one of the most important tasks we have before us 
the commission has given its commitment to this task and the draft for the overall package of internal reforms documents this 
parliament is committed to this task which is something this report bears impressive witness to 
on behalf of the commission i am able to congratulate the rapporteur on having again addressed the genuinely difficult question as to what we can do in terms of creating legal bases and effecting institutional change to step up the fight against fraud perpetrated against the european union 
on ratifying the amsterdam treaty all member states stated that they wanted to accord combating fraud against the financial interests of the european union the same priority as combating fraud to their own detriment 
yet as things stand only the first four member states have ratified the agreement concluded in 
a legislative act a directive in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money-laundering or corruptibility and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective may enable us to take a major step forwards and i will therefore advise the commission to examine this step with all due haste 
olaf the european anti-fraud office is one of the most important instruments the commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud 
accordingly the commission refused to put up with the fact that both european banks the ecb and the eib contested the right of olaf to include these two institutions in its investigations citing their independent status 
this is why the commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting and i hope that parliament approves this step 
the second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by olaf in the various european institutions 
it is the task of the monitoring committee for olaf which was set up at the same time as olaf to safeguard the independence of olaf however it cannot undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by olaf 
i am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point 
in other words there is a loophole here which must be filled and i will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on 
there is one thing i would ask though i believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for olaf from leading to the misconception that olaf does not now have enough authority 
thank you commissioner schreyer 
the vote will take place tomorrow at p.m 
these are both about voting 
is it not the case that on votes other than roll-call votes the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then if there is some doubt should we utilise the electronic voting system 
that is quite right mr heaton-harris 
i put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call 
you know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if members of the house request it 
in this particular case i can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on 
mr president i was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general 
it is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands so to speak but go straight to the electronic voting system 
i was wondering whether this is the correct procedure 
i know it takes longer but should we not always have a show of hands first 
i shall i assure you mr heaton-harris pay particular attention to the show of hands 
i hope to see many hands raised when the time comes to vote 
mr president as far as the second reading is concerned the commission can only accept one proposed amendment put forward by parliament 
the commission hereby adopts this amendment and accepts it 
 
the european budget is effectively sourced from vat and on the basis of gdp especially now that the community preference system has been abandoned and the multiplication of free trade areas has put paid to customs duties and the common agricultural levy which had already been cut back drastically by the generalised system of preferences 
since then community vat fraud and distortions in the calculation of gdp the taxable basis for the fourth resource have had a perceptible effect on the yield and justice of community resources 
since then of course this europe with pretensions to federalism is now more than ever financed like the commonplace intergovernmental organisation it actually is but which it refuses to see itself as 
this can be clearly seen in the regulation before us 
it shows a concern with the accounting involving own resources the process of making them available or with the monitoring of declared amounts made available to the commission 
furthermore the new advisory committee that has been created is made up of representatives of the taxpaying member states 
this is a long way from offshoots such as the community criminal code the european public prosecutor or a european police force with olaf 
there is as yet no federal european tax 
all the same a europe with members will be wanting a european tax on income if not on profits or the tax on co2 to finance the budget for 
in recent years the transportation of dangerous goods nationally and internationally has increased considerably increasing the risk of accidents 
some of these risks were due to an inadequate awareness of the risks inherent in such transportation 
it therefore proved necessary in the context of establishing the internal market to adopt some measures intended to ensure better risk prevention 
firms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the loading and unloading operations related to such transportation have been obliged quite rightly to comply with regulations regarding risk prevention whether road rail or inland waterway transport is involved 
this professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport 
while this represented significant progress at the time the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem 
it therefore seemed essential to make good this omission in order to achieve the standardised high-level training of safety advisers but also in order to avoid any disparities between the costs of training with a concomitant effect on competition between the firms of different member sates 
the commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised 
it outlines the minimum content of examinations and defines the role of the authorising body as well as the requirements demanded of the examining bodies 
parliament voted in favour of this text 
in order to be realistic i further support postponing the date for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force 
i shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advisers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users to minimising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods 
last october i expressed my views on the hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail 
the views i shall express today are not far removed from those i had then 
essentially my opinion is as follows i deplore the fact that in a field as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods we keep putting off the adoption of harmonised standards to the detriment of human beings and the environment 
i shall point out that a directive on the approximation of member state legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on january 
this included a number of interim conditions valid until january 
this is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the commission proposal to put an end to the derogations 
the cen has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted 
consequently the commission proposal under discussion today is intended to amend the directive in order to provide a short-term solution to these problems rather than to put an end to the transitional arrangements as should have been the case 
this is exactly what happened in the case of transport of such goods by rail except for the fact that a time limit had been decided 
right now we do not have the slightest idea as to when the cen will be in a position to put forward practical proposals 
until then there is really no point in member states amending their national regulations 
the report also accepts that some flexibility may be adopted and grants states the option of adopting or applying alternative standards 
they may therefore continue to enforce their own standards regarding certain types of pressure vessel used for transportation where there are no applicable european standards 
they may also adopt alternative conditions for transportation of a local nature and for ad hoc transportation 
in offering this explanation of my vote therefore i wished to express my deep dissatisfaction and my deep concern 
mr president i wanted to press home my explanation of vote by this oral explanation following on from the schroedter report with regard to regional development 
i would urge both the member states and the commission to give sufficient consideration to the huge disparities in wealth which continue to exist between the different regions in europe 
not only the difference in income per capita but above all large disparities in employment continue to give cause for concern 
despite the fact that the community through the structural funds among others injects considerable sums into combating the disparities between regional development opportunities in europe these disparities continue to exist 
i therefore wonder whether the community should not have a more drastic change of tack and based on very strict evaluations change its course and change its objectives in such a way as to make it possible to combat the disparities in wealth and employment more effectively 
mr president in relation to the schroedter report i am aware and have had it confirmed to me by mr barnier that the rules on additionality concerning structural funds apply only at the level of member states and do not apply in a transitive and transparent way inside member states in favour of self-governing regions such as wales or scotland 
i regard that as a very unsatisfactory state of affairs 
i hope we can revisit this issue at a later time 
i want it to be clear that though i voted in favour of the report i have this important reservation 
the schroedter report speaks of the need to promote partnerships with regard to the spending of eu structural funds in europe for the period 
i believe that this is particularly important as eu structural funds are always spent in a manner which maximises the economic development of different regions when local and regional authorities are involved in the decision-making process for the spending of such funds 
as a member of the european parliament for the constituency of leinster i have always supported the need for the implementation of bottom-up schemes supported by national eu funds 
i believe that the irish government and the european commission and different eu governments cannot alone decide on specific spending priorities 
i believe that local authorities and groups from the private and voluntary sector should be fully involved in the decision-making process for the spending of european structural funds 
for example we have seen the success of the leader i and leader ii schemes in ireland in terms of the jobs which have been created through the administration of these programmes in rural parts of ireland and within europe 
the leader iii scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year 
the leader programme at its core affords an opportunity for public private and voluntary groups to pool their collective talents so as to create long-term and sustainable jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas 
this is a classic example of how the partnership concept operates and such schemes must be supported in its broadest remit 
the european peace and reconciliation fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border counties in ireland 
once again there is active participation from groups from the private public and voluntary sectors which suggest how best particular funding can be spent so as to help different local job creation projects within this region 
during the next round of eu structural funds other eu initiatives such as equal and urban will be operating 
these initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best european structural funds should be spent 
the rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new eu structural fund plans and programmes 
they must promote a decentralised efficient and comprehensive partnership based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities 
this is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national european and local funding 
 
in order to reduce disparities between regions of course 
but more especially because even though at first sight the european market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy it may also be a source of inequality 
jacques delors was accustomed to saying that the market was short-sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparities 
it is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the european social model which we are all in favour of and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion 
this is a real political objective alongside economic and monetary affairs drawn up in collaboration with member states regions and local communities with the commission itself responsible for issuing guidelines in order to show member states what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programming 
this is why i shall support this report despite regretting the fact that for timetabling reasons the european parliament was only consulted at a very late date on the guidelines intended to assist member states regions and local communities in the programming of objectives and 
moreover i would also urge this house to take into consideration the opinion of the committee on employment and social affairs adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy 
it highlights the increasing vital role of all the parties involved chiefly those involved at a local level who are the only ones able to define specific requirements and social problems hence our determination to ensure that the partnerships to be established are true partnerships which are decentralised and involve all the agents concerned 
this is the reason for the request which we are putting forward again to establish a management unit for structural assistance in the member states which would coordinate the implementation and administration of aid 
in order to do so the monitoring committees must be opened to include members of the european parliament associations and industrialists concerned by the projects and also civil society 
these guidelines represent a step towards the improved effectiveness of community structural aid 
amended again as such by the schroedter report they are a step in the right direction 
they also call for a general debate on the future of the cohesion policy after but that is another subject 
in the meantime let us support this first step 
this report calls for drastic cuts in the level of illegal state aid dished out by some member states 
although i wholeheartedly support this aim i would much rather see such aid eliminated altogether 
in my mind illegal state aid amounts to little more than state-sponsored social dumping 
we all oppose social dumping when perpetrated by fat cat industry we must also oppose it when perpetrated by governments 
if we are to have an effective single market that makes european industry globally competitive and generates wealth and employment for all europeans then we must have a level playing field 
illegal state aid by contrast destroys competitive companies and creates unemployment 
there are of course cases when state aid can be necessary and legitimate for example helping companies restructure 
in all such cases however strict criteria must be met and prior approval from the european commission gained 
whether we are talking about beef to france or about backhanders to industry eu member states must not be allowed to flout the law 
i enthusiastically support the report's proposal to publish a scoreboard showing the amount of state aid per member state 
countries that claim to be at the heart of europe but which systematically break its rules should be named and shamed and their hypocrisy revealed 
member states cannot be allowed to proclaim european solidarity in public while trying to undermine the single market in private 
i take some mild encouragement from the fact that levels of state aid to industry in europe appear to be falling 
much remains to be done however and i call on the commission to be far tougher in exposing the subsidy junkies of europe 
 
it is therefore crucial that the european parliament drafts its broad indicative guidelines without threatening the principle of subsidiarity given that establishing the development strategy for each country falls to the respective member states 
it is nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with the greatest problems and of the outermost regions of which the portuguese regions of the azores and madeira are examples 
this must be done with the objective of achieving economic and social cohesion 
on the other hand it is crucial that there are precise indications and sufficient funds in areas such as creating decent jobs with rights effectively promoting equality in law and opportunity and supporting the social economy and solidarity 
there must also be support for rural development for small and medium-sized enterprises for improving the quality of life of urban populations in deprived areas specifically in the field of social housing with a view to achieving sustainable urban development 
 
in the first place if administrative procedures are not simplified it will be hard to attain community objectives on reform with a view to greater efficiency and concentration 
in this respect the commission document has shortcomings as it makes no recommendation to the member states to simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities and for their funding execution and monitoring 
smes micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still weak operators given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some member states including italy are major obstacles to accessing structural funds 
a considerable stumbling block is the fact that the regions and other operators find it impossible and are incapable of making plans in time 
in fact it found a sort of convenient excuse in the shortening of the programming stage in the member states and it published the guidelines back in july even before the new parliament had taken up its legislative duties thereby preventing parliament itself from having any influence on the current content of the guidelines 
in general the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent 
they merely touch on the nevertheless important issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to verifiable objectives which are completely consonant with the strategies followed in community policies and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities or candidate countries 
that said the differing approach adopted in the guidelines which are not geared to geographical objectives but rather to policy areas can be considered as positive 
while in theory this may meet the need for concentration and therefore the efficiency of interventions we cannot help wondering whether the current situation of the objective zones allows in practice a policy of integrated interventions for which an operational instrument to coordinate the appropriations is necessary 
the guidelines as adopted by the commission are very limited because instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance they are providing a shopping list of possible measures a shopping list which as it fails to set priorities in ascending order could even put the member states on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration 
we could say that in this state of affairs we have once again missed the opportunity to really strengthen sustainable urban development by ring-fencing ever-increasing urbanisation and hence the destruction of the countryside 
there has been no appropriate assessment of the importance of the global grant instrument which could prove to be extremely useful in redressing the balance between urban and rural zones and moreover would accord proper status to local bodies which being independent could bring about the conditions for territorial development more quickly and make a practical contribution to the efforts to reform the structural funds and to achieve the objectives of efficiency concentration and administrative reform 
rural areas must truly be seen as a resource which should be increasingly invested in by encouraging young people to remain in rural areas in order to prevent their economic and social disintegration 
it is now a fact that in order to attain this goal rural areas need to see the creation of new jobs which are no longer solely connected with agriculture in the traditional sense although this sector is important for the protection of the environment and the preservation of biodiversity but also for instance in rural tourism sport and cultural activities environmental projects smes services and so on 
a genuine flaw in the guidelines are specific guidelines for the orchestration of coordination between the esf and employment strategy 
the fact that this coordination is being put into effect for the first time during the programme period implies that the member states really do need guidelines 
i must also stress that once again the commission is in fact skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities 
in conclusion the document is not particularly satisfactory and in some aspects is disappointing 
 
we shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues 
firstly and as the commission itself states it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita gdp between and was largely due to the inclusion of the new german länder in calculating the community average from onwards 
we also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions where it did actually take place was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment 
this consequently imposes the need for new development strategies with a considerably greater level of attention needing to be paid to this area 
this situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the member states which is what the report proposes 
the huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same state mean that there is a need for an in-depth assessment of this issue 
 
nonetheless the french members of the union for a europe of nations group feels it cannot approve some of the statements made therein 
paragraph for example draws attention to the special need to consolidate the budget as a prerequisite for the success of economic and monetary union and the enlargement of the union 
at a time when in order to fulfil the convergence criteria member states are forced to undergo a strict budgetary slimming regime one that would be perfectly justified if they undertook it of their own initiative the federalists are displaying an astonishing pecuniary gluttony 
as an admission of the failure of the cohesion policy and emu the lack of results is put down to the lack of money with everyone competing in eloquence to demand more and more appropriations without anyone asking questions about the effectiveness of the money spent 
what can one say about a budgetary procedure which involves setting objectives for expenditure rather than a ceiling on expenditure and trying at all costs to find projects in order to spend the approved appropriations rather than allocating the appropriations to existing projects 
expenditure becomes an end in itself evidence of the success of a programme 
the relative weight of the most wealthy regions of the european union was strengthened between et testifying to a concentration of wealth jobs and activity in certain areas hamburg brussels antwerp luxembourg the paris region darmstadt oberbayern bremen vienna karlsruhe and emilia-romagna 
the poorest regions are gradually making good their underdevelopment 
in the average of the poorest regions amounted to % of the overall community gnp 
in it was % 
progress is particularly marked in portugal and ireland 
in fact if the rich are ever more wealthy and the extremely poor are less poor then it seems that the middle-range regions covered by objective are experiencing an occasionally significant downturn in their gnp and a worsening of the employment situation 
this phenomenon is particularly marked in france the gnp of the champagne-ardennes region which it is my honour to represent has gone from % to % of the community average that of the loire region has dropped from % to % and that of the auvergne from % to % 
this is a generalised tendency sparing neither the rhône-alpes nor alsace 
it has been confirmed in sweden and finland countries where unemployment has in fact increased to a worrying degree over the last few years as in many regions of the united kingdom 
it may therefore seem strange that when the structural funds were reformed objective dedicated to industrial and rural areas undergoing economic restructuring should have been sacrificed in favour of objectives and 
for the period the total appropriation for this objective will be ecu billion a figure more or less identical to that for the period 
the rural regions eligible under objective will be included among the main victims of this situation in france % of the populations eligible for structural funds are going to lose their eligibility at the end of the transition period a figure which is occasionally much larger in some regions such as the loire region alsace or lower normandy political strongholds of the right-wing that were the victims of the petty political vote chasing of the left-wing coalition government 
based as it is on such choices it is to be doubted whether regional policy can contribute to harmonious regional planning within the member states of the european union 
 
as an example i would give the restructuring of abb alsthom power 
a sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout europe is visiting strasbourg today 
the management of abb alsthom power following a merger carried out in june announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries 
this damaging situation for employment raises many questions particularly regarding the information given to the european works council in existence since 
it suggests that the community directive on european works councils must be updated and strengthened 
it also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment the environment and consumers into consideration 
since the report of the committee on economic and monetary affairs did not go far enough in this respect i abstained 
 
issues of mergers and state aid however still remain within the notification system 
the position that has now been adopted aims to create more rapid ways of applying competition policy moving towards applying community law in national courts rather than at the european court of justice and even aims at having specialised courts 
this partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for member states 
on the other hand as the rapporteur points out in the name of competition policy public monopolies are often exchanged for private monopolies with the privatisation of important industries and public companies as has happened in portugal with harmful consequences for the country and its workers 
but it does at least make it possible to anticipate some rather interesting options for development of the european union 
in fact taking note of the congestion of its services due to the prior notification system of state agreements likely to cause distortions in trade and afraid of seeing the number of notifications increase yet further with the arrival of new member states the commission is proposing to do away with the prior notification system of such agreements and to apply competition rules at member state level in a more decentralised fashion 
the most remarkable thing in my view is the message conveyed by this proposal that the commission is anticipating the consequences of enlargement and realising that this necessarily and virtually automatically requires reform of the centralised system 
admittedly this reform is one of increasing flexibility rather than dismantling 
indeed the white paper envisages that the commission will retain the supervision and central direction of the new system 
moreover the von wogau report which the european parliament has just voted on supports it in so doing 
but at the same time one can clearly see that the upheaval caused by enlargement may lead to community competences being limited and subsidiarity being extended 
it is a quite different europe which is taking shape in the long term 
is this not indeed what is so distressing to some socialist members of the european parliament 
the german social democrats voted against the von wogau report because in their view it might break up european policy on competition which is to say in plain terms attacking the standardising superstate 
curiously a number of employers agreed with them preferring the european one-stop system which they consider to be more economical and more stable legally 
indeed this is one advantage of the present system 
but on the other hand the wider view must also be taken namely that the initial decentralisation which has been begun today may in the long term lead to greater freedom to take the requirements of each country into account and this will be of benefit to everyone 
the members of parliament from the lutte ouvrière party shall not be voting in favour of these reports on european competition policy 
competition is a war which has major concerns fighting each other which constantly takes the form of layoffs factory closures not to mention extensive waste of production capacity 
we see a further example of this with the planned layoffs in europe proposed by the corporation abb alsthom power 
eighteen million unemployed and million poor people within the european union despite its being one of the wealthiest regions in the world these are the results of this competition which the european institutions intend to promote 
this is repulsive most of all in social terms 
there is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment nothing to protect employees nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still 
we acknowledge that this report does have one good point it shows that the working class majority in society can expect nothing from the european institutions in terms of safeguarding their living conditions and still less of improving them 
 
nevertheless when he spoke about a few instruments which are crucial to achieving the objectives that have been mentioned the rapporteur did little more than criticise various aspects of state aid and demand the harmonisation of rules concerning the repayment of illegal state aid 
this threatens the right of member states with a weaker and structurally more vulnerable economy to support economic sectors which have suffered as a result of liberalisation and international competition 
on the other hand the rapporteur ignores the main causes of the distortion of the rules on competition specifically the growing number of mergers and their consequences for that distortion 
another cause is the turning of public companies into private monopolies with serious implications for society specifically for employment and for the cost of public services 
another main cause of distortion to the rules of competition is the abuse of their dominant positions by various cartels which maintain unacceptable practices in social and environmental terms including the sacking of thousands of workers 
that is why we are voting against this report 
we are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services in memory of the victims of the paddington rail disaster killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulations 
this report is essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century 
whether it is a matter of the balance of the biosphere culture or cooperation with the third world excessive competition is a factor increasing regression and insecurity 
do you imagine that the million unemployed people in europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy 
we are convinced that the opposite is true and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive 
excessive in comparison with what iron rule what criteria of efficiency 
finally after seattle do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the wto 
only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness 
i am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the eu and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report and also that the directorate-general for competition will be making information both general and specific publicly accessible via its website 
there is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition 
admittedly an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union 
clearly though it must be monitored a task which falls to the european commission 
the aid which union member states allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of eur billion in the period including % allocated to the manufacturing sector 
this downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new german länder 
like the rapporteur i deplore the fact that the figures given in the report do not cover all state aid 
the european commission must make good these omissions as soon as possible 
it must also cooperate with the member states in order to improve the quality of data in good time which is to say in time for the ninth report 
i think it would be a good idea if the commission published a register specifying the amount of state aid per member state 
i also deplore the fact that the european parliament has been totally excluded from the advisory committee on state aid 
in order to compensate for this situation the european commission should be obliged to make regular reports to us 
i shall conclude with one aspect of the use of state aid which i feel is particularly dangerous the matter of aid resulting in businesses relocating from one member state to another with the risk of subsidy hunting which makes no contribution to the shared objectives of the eu 
this is why i should like to see the next report on state aid include some assessment of the effect of such aid on employment industry and craft businesses in the beneficiary countries 
just as the court of justice recognised in its order of may the iron and steel industry is particularly sensitive to disturbances to its competitive operation 
this indeed is the purpose of the sixth steel aid code 
at the same time it is of course essential to avoid any disturbance of competition conditions or of the markets hence the importance of regulating such aid 
it is therefore essential to continue to restrict state aid to research and development environmental protection and aid granted in the event of plant closure 
in the same way it is vital for member states to fulfil their obligation to report to the commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings as stipulated under article of the steel aid code 
the commission suggests that member states submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six-month period or at least annually without the need for reminders 
like the rapporteur i am pleased with the commission report but i did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid 
although the steel aid code is expressed in a very clear way the commission has on a number of occasions authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code 
in the interests of equality there are grounds to either apply the steel aid code strictly or modify the code if the commission wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment 
finally we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ecsc treaty 
the aid system must effectively be continued beyond 
my feeling in this respect is that only a council regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not covered by the code 
the next item is the commission statement on the oil slick off the french coast 
mrs de palacio will open the debate on behalf of the commission 
mr president i would firstly like to thank parliament for offering me the opportunity to hold a debate on the disaster which has occurred off the french coast as a result of the sinking of the oil tanker erika on december which resulted in more than kilometres of coastline being contaminated with spilt oil leading to the death of thousands of birds and other enormously adverse effects from the point of view of the environment and the preservation of our seas and of clean coastlines which meet the minimum requirements of a developed society 
in a way the sinking of the erika is the antithesis of what we have all been fighting for sustainable development development which is respectful of the environment 
it is a clear violation of that approach to development and progress a flagrant example of the way things should not be done 
i could expand on the specific facts which led to this accident 
i will not do so 
we all know them and i simply want to say that the commission shares the indignation not only of those who live along the french coastline who are the first to be affected by this disaster but also all those europeans and non-europeans who may face similar disasters 
the commission immediately expressed its solidarity and has wanted to contribute to combating the tragic consequences of this event with all the means at its disposal 
but in my opinion it is not sufficient simply to combat these consequences 
we should also seek solutions and proposals which will give the best possible assurance that events such as this do not recur 
thus from the environmental point of view i must say that in collaboration with and at the request of the french authorities immediately after the sinking commissioner wallström who is in charge of the environment created an environmental crisis unit 
this unit set up the community marine pollution working group and offered the french authorities the best european experts in the combating of pollution 
the commission also participated in the deployment of tools for combating pollution in the area of the disaster coordinating the actions of eleven member states of the union who have sent more than kilometres of floating barriers to the area 
we believe that this coordination and its results represent a degree of progress and success demonstrating a genuine sense of european solidarity 
this state of affairs is partly the result of work carried out by the commission over recent years 
this work consisted particularly of the creation of a community system which gathers all available information relating to the existing community resources for combating this type of pollution the establishment of a community working group and the joint financing of the project to develop and improve the techniques for combating pollution within the european union 
as well as the emergency proposal it is also necessary in the long term to maintain the capacity to confront other similar disasters 
therefore the commission is delighted that parliament has favourably received at first reading its draft decision on the establishment of a legal framework which will improve cooperation in combating accidental pollution 
the commission hopes that recent events will speed up the final approval of this text in parliament and the council and will therefore allow us to move beyond the current situation 
however with regard to transport i would like to say that the sinking of the erika once again raises the problem of the prevention of marine accidents and more specifically safety in the transport of polluting products 
in this case in the field of sea transport 
in this respect i believe that firstly it is essential to highlight the fact that the european union has not been inactive since the notorious sinking of the amoco cadiz in off the french coast 
nevertheless perhaps we should ask ourselves whether we need to do more 
over the last six years some fifteen community regulations and directives have been adopted 
this legislation is still recent 
the states have now been provided with a legal framework which allows them to tackle the issue of flags of convenience as well as all of those parties who fail to fulfil their safety obligations 
it now falls to the member states to demonstrate that they have the political will to provide their marine authorities with the necessary means to carry out their tasks with regard to control and the application of community regulations of applying and adequately demanding compliance with those community regulations which have already been approved 
and of course the commission must be certain to ensure that in the member states these regulations are applied in a consistent manner 
with regard to the sinking of the erika the results of the preliminary investigation carried out by the french authorities on the causes of the accident have been communicated to the commission 
the report demonstrates the lightweight nature to use a euphemism of the controls which have been applied in this case 
i must say that the commission for its part since december has approached the italian authorities in charge of port inspections as well as the classification society rina which was responsible for the most recent classifications of the erika with a view to receiving explanations regarding the way that the erika has been inspected 
the commission must ascertain whether the relevant community directives were correctly applied in this case both by the italian authorities as the port state as well as the company rina as the classification society 
these checks mr president are essential with regard to perfecting the directives in the future and our ability to improve on the action which is being taken 
in any event i would like to inform parliament that on the of next month a special mission from the commission will go to inspect the company rina and in accordance with the conclusions of this mission we will take any necessary steps 
when i say we will take the necessary steps i include the possibility of removing rina from the list of companies accredited by the commission 
the commission also made a similar request to the maritime authority in malta the erika was flying the maltese flag which i must point out has so far offered us its full cooperation 
however without pre-empting the results of these investigations how the sinking happened what the real reasons were and how the inspections were carried out both by rina and by the italian port authorities all indications suggest that the erika accident raises a series of questions which merit close attention and require us in my opinion to act with the greatest urgency 
the commission was already preparing a communication on safety in sea transport and port safety 
however these events clearly oblige us to speed up the presentation of this communication and above all to concentrate on the transport of dangerous goods and pollutants especially oil gas and chemical products 
this document will be accompanied by a series of legislative proposals intended to improve maritime safety in community waters 
the commission intends to adopt them before june of this year so that the debates on the proposed measures may begin both in this parliament and in the council as from the second six-month period of under the french presidency 
the world average is around incidences in inspections carried out in european ports 
in the case of ships flying the maltese flag as is the case with the erika the figure is and in the case of other flags it is much higher still 
in order to strengthen controls we will amend the existing directives on classification companies the control of ships in ports and the frequency of inspections relating them to the age and flag of the ship 
in the case of cars we all know that after four years they have to undergo a technical inspection every year 
however in the case of ships this is unfortunately not the case 
secondly in european ports we should promote the use of oil tankers which respect the environment 
that is to say the oil tankers which come to our ports should become double hull tankers instead of the single hull ones which present a greater risk of pollution in the event of accidents 
the latter should be subject to measures intended to progressively phase them out more quickly in the way that is happening in the united states and we will thereby remove the risk which we are facing at the moment of oil tankers which cannot dock in american ports being diverted to european ports 
thirdly the communication will deal with the complex and delicate issue of liability and the payment of compensation in the event of pollution resulting from a disaster 
the commission intends to escape the current legal quagmire and present proposals to raise the maximum limits of liability of the parties involved and furthermore to include new parties in the chain of liability which at present consists almost exclusively of shipowners 
more specifically we intend to establish a system which will allow us to determine the liability of the owner or forwarder of the cargo and hold them liable indeed it is because there are forwarders who show little concern for the quality of the ships they charter that shipowners choose to register their vessels abroad as well as increasing the insurance premium paid by shipowners in respect of the total sum insured per ship 
finally the commission intends to continue in its efforts to improve transparency with regard to the quality of the ships sailing in european waters 
in this regard the commission proposes to speed up the implementation of the equasix system which must be in place as from may of this year which is no more and no less than a system for up-to-date information on the situation of the international fleet to which all these ships belong 
this programme is being developed in common agreement with the french authorities and will provide up-to-date and comprehensive information about the situation of individual ships not to mention the composition of the crews which is also an important factor 
in conclusion it is not just a matter of the erika disaster and what has been done up till now but rather of reaching conclusions so that we can prevent the recurrence of this type of disaster 
we must guarantee the effective application of the regulations on maritime safety 
the international maritime organisation as we all know has the capacity neither for controlling nor for making mandatory the regulations subscribed to by some states who often forget their commitments and close their eyes to put it mildly to the obligations they have signed up to in these conventions 
secondly we must continue to try to achieve greater competitivity in the european shipping sector which is a sector capable of very high levels of safety maintaining a high level of requirement but we must also be capable with regard to flags of convenience of combating the abuses which occur in relation to these flags 
finally ladies and gentlemen we must combat the irresponsibility of some shipowners some forwarders some states some companies and some operators in the field of maritime transport who through their irresponsibility endanger our natural environment and may create disasters such as the one which has unfortunately happened recently along the french coastline 
mr president i shall be speaking on behalf of the ppe-de group but also as an elected representative for brittany and i am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events 
together with mrs grossetête and the ppe-de group we tabled a motion for a resolution 
i am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion 
the erika shipwreck is a truly european issue firstly because it is disfiguring and polluting some of the most beautiful beaches in europe with extremely serious consequences for tourism people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalists and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a european scale 
a disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the american coastline and why 
because the americans managed to learn their lesson from the exxon valdez disaster and in to draw up the oil pollution act which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities as it makes it possible to hold the charterer liable and is more restrictive and more especially more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and in particular the existence of the american coastguard 
if i repeat we had had regulations of this type then this disaster would surely not have occurred 
this is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed particularly the protocol which has exempted the shipowners in this case the oil tanker charterer from any liability 
well if the charterer is exonerated then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for 
the regulations must therefore be reviewed and i thank you commissioner for highlighting the inadequate features of current european regulations 
moreover as you said monitoring must above all be stepped up that of the flag state that of the classification societies 
you told us that rina was an italian classification register recognised by the commission 
what are the conditions for this recognition 
what guarantees are there of its reliability 
you are going to commission a fact-finding mission 
we await the outcome with great interest 
inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within european ports must also be tightened up 
there is a paris memorandum in existence let me remind you which stipulates a minimum for inspection that is one in four of the vessels putting into european ports must be inspected by the maritime authorities of the country concerned 
this obligation is not respected either in france or in many other european countries 
why not 
what conclusions has the commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw 
i also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for in this case the oil company 
finally we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of european facility comparable to the coastguards who supervise the coasts of the united states 
firstly i would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team 
this disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area 
here we are here again in this parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster 
i could reel off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my years in this parliament but i only have three minutes 
surely it is now about time that not only the member states but that toothless tiger that is known as the international maritime organisation and last but not least the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year 
how many more erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the european union not just certain areas of it 
how much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds 
how many more seabirds are to die before shipping companies end the practice of cleaning their tanks at sea which as our resolution points out causes far more pollution than any erika-type disaster 
we need the member states to act quickly and decisively 
we need our governments to put up the financial resources needed to give us effective control and we need them also to stop dragging their feet when it comes to maritime safety 
the erika cost no human lives but it may have ruined many human livelihoods 
just as the sea empress just as the braer did 
it is absolutely certain that all three left us with an ecological disaster 
my group's sympathy goes out to the people of brittany who have seen their area despoiled by this disaster just as my group's sympathy went out to the people of west wales and to the shetland islands on previous occasions 
is it not about time that we stopped expressing sympathy and started issuing enforcement notices to get rid of these ships of shame in favour of safe seas or we will be back again later on this year discussing a new motion for a resolution when yet another flag-of-convenience tanker sadly goes down spewing its crude oil all over the sea 
the time for resolutions has passed 
what is now needed is action 
sadly i fear the council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster 
mr president every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again 
in reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future 
the erika incident was serious especially for the people of brittany most closely affected but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of europe 
some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of europe 
the royal society for the protection of birds believes that as many as birds perhaps mainly guillemots may have died 
the pictures many of us will have seen of oil-soaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic 
we all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying 
we need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the polluter pays principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced 
i agree with every word the commissioner said in her remarks but the question is how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes 
as a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this parliament in a year were a similar incident just as devastating to take place if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice 
the thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully 
mr president commissioner i have brought you a small gift 
here is a cake of oil sent by someone living on the french island of noirmoutier who wrote to me as follows with every tide the beach is covered with heavy fuel oil which has leaked out of the erika 
with every tide the volunteers members of the armed forces and firemen remove great pancakes of this thick sticky black tar 
when will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident 
indeed this disaster involving the erika like that of the russian vessel in turkey moreover is unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi-tech technology is available 
it is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the amoco cadiz disaster despite our saying at the time and many times since never again 
it is of course the responsibility of policies and therefore our responsibility to guarantee the safety of sea transport 
we absolutely have to guarantee our citizens that a disaster of this type will never happen again 
but listening to you commissioner we are somewhat frustrated because anyone already involved in these matters knows that in i believe the commission and parliament drew up a very interesting text which already contained all the proposals included in the resolution drawn up by the transport committee 
indeed we must say and keep saying that the erika is one disaster too many 
this is why it is essential as a matter of urgency for the european union to undertake a radical review of its directives on sea transport to make them more restrictive and to establish clear and specific regulations determining the responsibilities of the owners of the cargoes 
we should be aware for example that shell and british petroleum refused to use the erika to transport their oil 
why in these circumstances is the liability of total as charterer not recognised 
your proposals must also include making double hulls mandatory and enforcing observance at last of the ban on degassing at sea 
a european inspection body must be established which can monitor the condition of vessels effectively and efficiently 
in addition it is also essential for the european union to undertake to reform the imo as a matter of urgency 
what point is there in issuing restrictive directives if once they are at sea most vessels do just what they wish 
finally a compassionate thought for all the volunteers nature lovers and bird lovers who spontaneously and generously are coming through to the aid of the oil-covered birds organising rescue operation with the means available 
i can testify to this remarkable work 
you are no doubt aware that approximately birds are going to die as a result of this oil slick which is a major ecological disaster practically unprecedented in scale 
in relation to this you are no doubt also aware how difficult it is nowadays to preserve natural species as well as natural spaces 
and on this subject commissioner you did not mention how the commission intends to contribute to the restoration of the natural environment and the natural habitats 
once again there will be no clearly defined party responsible 
in the meantime it is nature that is taking the rap as always 
mr president my group asked that this debate be set up in order to provide parliament with an opportunity to express its solidarity with the people directly affected by this ecological disaster affected both in terms of their economic activities and in terms of their attachment to their natural environment 
let me in this connection welcome the presence in the visitors' gallery of mrs javette-le besque spokesperson for the oil slick action group marée noire made up of men and women from the french department of morbihan 
many volunteers from france and other european countries have expressed their solidarity by lending a hand to the victims in the field 
as the european parliament we can express our solidarity primarily by taking action in order to ensure the immediate release of emergency aid to the families affected by the oil slick and at the same time demanding tightening up of the quality criteria on the european and international scale of the regulations and standards governing the safety of sea transport stipulating much more frequent inspection and sanctions that are a far greater deterrent to offenders 
our proposals are particularly concerned with the age of oil tankers 
among those inspected and found to be in contravention of regulations last year were at least years old and some were and more 
this is no longer tolerable 
next we have flags of convenience 
according to the international transport federation over % of the ships wrecked in were sailing under flags of convenience the symbol of profit and the exploitation of human beings at the expense of safety 
this is no longer tolerable 
finally there is the lack of transparency 
everything is done to make the lines of responsibility the identity of the owners and real decision-makers as impenetrable as possible 
this is no longer tolerable 
in all these respects we must ensure real significant change including setting a time limit for the switch to new standards including the mandatory double hull on pain of being banned from the ports or the territorial waters of member states 
we must also ensure increased strictness both in issuing sea-worthiness certificates and in monitoring the condition and the maintenance of vessels 
finally we must ensure that all the parties responsible for disasters contribute to repairing the damage caused 
i am thinking specifically of total-fina in the present instance 
this is an approach mr president which the european union can develop with regard to the international maritime organisation 
in so doing it will have proved its usefulness to public opinion which in this instance is awaiting clear tangible action 
mr president commissioner as a member for the french atlantic coast for vendée i should first like to express the disgust of the people who are the victims of the erika oil slick in the face of these disasters caused not by a natural disaster such as the hurricane which has also just struck us but by a crime 
in this emergency in this ordeal we have seen a magnificent display of solidarity local solidarity national solidarity and intergovernmental solidarity 
what the stricken populations are waiting for now those who have lost everything particularly among those who made their living from the sea and from tourism those people whose businesses have been compromised for several years to come is not for the polluters to repair the damage they have caused but for the gears to now be set in motion to ensure that their present misfortune serves to prevent similar crimes affecting other people in future 
quite clearly we are now paying the price for our lack of concern 
because our states with the blessing of the community did not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding know-how to disappear we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships navigating our waters under flags of convenience drifting according to the short-term interests of the multinationals 
it is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility irresponsible charterers untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies 
so today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion 
obviously such matters should be handled at world level but the current international regulations of the imo are far from adequate and are far too loose and neither our own countries nor the community have tried determinedly to make them stricter despite previous disasters 
admittedly there is the international oil pollution compensation fund iopcf but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level which must be reviewed 
the question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the imo 
it is up to the members states and the community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this 
let me remind you that the erika was sailing under a flag of convenience that of a state applying for membership of the european union 
in addition there are community directives but they are seldom applied if at all due to the insufficient number of national inspectors 
this omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency 
a directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years but it is making very slow progress 
the commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings 
the date when the commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again 
it is now scheduled for july 
this must be brought forward 
the terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict 
i shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities 
firstly the liability of owners of oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally 
the best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can offer charterers that they will be heavily penalised in civil criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigilant regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they select 
secondly the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely 
thirdly a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to community waters must be established in the near future 
this could be of a maximum of years of age 
if we do not obtain a framework of community regulations which is sufficiently clear strict and trenchant then those member states that wish to do so must be allowed to take the necessary steps to protect their people and their territory in the same way that the united states succeeded in learning the lessons of the exxon valdez disaster by making double hulls compulsory and banning all vessels more than years old from their waters 
thus the erika was refused access to american waters 
if the european community had done the same a great disaster would have been avoided 
let us ensure mr president commissioner that this time we really do learn the lesson even after the media hype and the shock of this house have died down 
mr president torrey canyon olympic bravery haven amoco cadiz gino tanio so many names we remember with horror 
and now the erika 
whose turn is next 
twenty one years after amoco cadiz this umpteenth oil slick the seventh since shows the irresponsibility of our successive rulers 
the atlantic west coast once again is paying a high price for their inability to react for their capitulation to the multinationals 
it is hard to understand why the french and the europeans allow something which the americans refuse to accept and why europe normally so quick to pass environmental legislation has chosen to overlook the matter of maritime safety 
and this is the result 
the erika a vessel flying a maltese flag a floating rust bucket classed amongst the most dangerous type of oil tankers has contaminated more than km of our coastline a case of pollution even worse than that caused by the amoco cadiz 
as an elected representative for the loire-atlantique region unfortunately i can testify to this 
there is nothing natural about these recurring disasters they are the result of fate 
they are the result of human thoughtlessness 
what we have here is an ecological disaster 
only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that 
it is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism fishermen oyster farmers shellfish farmers people who make a living from the salt marshes shopkeepers etc 
the erika disaster must be the last in the series 
first of all we must shed some light on this shipwreck 
why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get members of parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the commission 
next as a matter of urgency we muss pass legislation firstly regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported 
in fact according to the experts the oil the erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast 
we know what actually happened 
next reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in france for vehicles more than five years old 
we must regulate the use of flags of convenience make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea 
this would be a minimum requirement i believe on the dawn of the third millennium 
non-compliant vessels must be denied access to european waters the responsibility of polluters shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the polluter pays maritime supervision must be strengthened to prevent any degassing thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required an appropriate natural disasters budget line must be re-established for member states and in the meantime community aid released on an exceptional basis and the french departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for structural funds 
i have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the edd group 
mr president in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning 
it is particularly bad this time not least because it has affected a major european state an incident which could happen again at any time 
we urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks 
the clearly do not suffice 
these guarantee making no claim to be exhaustive a minimum of things 
no tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the european union again 
all those involved including the transport agent are responsible for any ensuing damage and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances 
this is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation 
however we must aim higher in the long-term let there be no mistake about that 
in other words we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system 
mr president may i start by saying that i would like to thank commissioner palacio very much for her clear adequate and at the same time very firm response 
many thanks for this 
this also means that in any case i have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on january but also for the action points which she announced today 
the erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and european level nature and the environment come off second-best 
the damage suffered also in ecological terms cannot be expressed in money 
hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management members 
during the christmas break when the dutch media received attention for the erika disaster i had a look just out of interest on the internet to see what arrangements were in fact already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures especially after premier jospin had said that europe should do more 
what i learned is that actually there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision 
could i highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the commissioner 
first of all the port-state control according to which % of all ships require inspection 
i think that this % should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place 
so this % should be increased 
furthermore if a ship is no longer seaworthy not only should the facts be examined but a legal system should be introduced which states or recommends that the vessel should no longer be used 
but this is not in place 
mr president i would welcome some action in this area 
finally as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned some members have already mentioned just now that since in the united states ships should in any case be double-hulled 
in my opinion we should look further into this point and i also think that the marpol treaty which comes into effect in should be looked at very closely 
mr president i would like to take a brief critical look at the accession negotiations with malta and would like to express my gratitude to and admiration for the many ngos that have at least rolled up their sleeves in order to save animals 
mr president we have already had this discussion so many times in the past 
we have achieved nothing so far and we have been unable to reach agreement within the european union 
that is why i will only believe that there is any point to having this debate today if what we are all saying today and what the commissioner has announced here actually leads to legislation being produced in other words if you all go and say to your heads of government and ministers you must push this through in the council of ministers 
allow me to say first that what we are talking about is an environmental catastrophe which also impacts on the economy and threatens livelihoods 
so what are we to do now 
i have no intention of talking about past events rather i want to look to the future 
what are we to do now 
i will tell you a few things we should do 
of course we need double-hulled vessels 
that goes without saying but it is something that will only work through in the medium and long term 
so what do we need to happen immediately 
we need technical testing of ships that is obligatory technical testing every two years and no ship to be operated without the accompanying certificate 
we need this at european level and internationally we need something like a tüv an organisation that undertakes technical testing of motor vehicles in germany which is compulsory every two years 
if you do not have a certificate then you are not allowed to operate the vehicle 
this is what we need for ships 
thirdly we need to carry out checks on these safety and insurance certificates in the ports that is in every port of the european union 
any failure to produce these certificates must lead to the ship being laid up and prohibited from leaving the port regardless of all the port charges 
fourthly we need the shipowner to bear liability and not just to the tune of a derisory usd million but to the value of at least usd million to be covered per insurance certificate 
we also need the country whose flag the ship flies to bear liability 
we need to be sure that if need be the country whose flag the ship is flying will accept liability 
this would be a marvellous exercise in supervision 
i can assure you that those countries awarding flags would then take great care to avoid having to accept liability 
in the fifth place we need there to be a guarantee that these demands will apply to all ships using the ports and waterways of the european union and incidentally that includes the candidate countries 
last but not least we need a long memory for the issue of legislation will crop up on the agenda more frequently in the near future 
environmental standards will be a recurring theme 
i would not like to have someone coming and saying that these requirements will lead to job losses in the ports 
the unions will have something to say as will industry 
a long memory will serve us well ladies and gentlemen 
i am looking at all those of you who have not exactly been at the forefront of the environmental movement 
just you go home and say we have not concerned ourselves with standards to date 
we need to have a long memory when it comes to the demands being made in the ports 
we need to have a long memory when we say for once we are united at last as far as port charges and requirements are concerned and will not play one off against the other in the european union 
if we succeed in this then perhaps we will be better off in a few years' time 
mr president mrs roth-behrendt expressed very many of my own thoughts 
we have now obtained a first-rate enumeration of a variety of measures 
but how do we make use of the sense of crisis to which this ecological disaster has led 
where is the sense of crisis which generations before us had 
i consider that what we should adopt is the form of certification that mrs roth-behrendt speaks about the identification in the form of green marks on tankers which certain harbours in europe have brought up for discussion 
we must also critically examine the classification societies 
i do not think that we can accept their procedures 
we need independent procedures and procedures involving public control 
finally i want to say that when my country provides environmental aid to shipowners who wish to improve the quality of the environment there are units within the commission who regard this as prohibited aid to shipyards 
within the commission the one hand does not know what the other hand is doing 
i shall only add that it would be the least that total could do to compensate for the direct and indirect damage caused by the oil slick 
how can we stop similar disasters occurring in future if we do not institute draconian measures against the major oil corporations and indeed many others who in order to make more profit take the risk of making the world uninhabitable 
the crux of the problem is that all governments and indeed all the european institutions acknowledge the right of major corporations such as total-fina and its ilk to maximise profits whether it be harmful to their employees or to the environment 
they accept the professional confidentiality of business and banks even though this same confidentiality serves to conceal what are essentially criminal actions 
in these circumstances even the best resolutions will remain little more than appeals to principle which are powerless to limit the great corporations' capacity to cause damage 
mr president i am in favour of tightening up the legislation on port state control and on classification societies 
however we must stick to the facts 
the ship erika has been investigated four times in the course of the last two years 
the answer cannot lie in the number of investigations but rather in guaranteeing the rigour with which the controls are undertaken 
i have heard in the course of the discussions that have taken place in the last few weeks that the member states do not have enough money to undertake the controls 
i cannot accept this 
if the member states decide in agreement with ourselves that % of ships are to be monitored on the basis of port state control then they must also make the necessary personnel available 
the controls must also be carried out in such a way that the inspector does not just go on board and check whether there are any fire extinguishers missing rather there must be materials testing for this ship obviously broke up on account of material fatigue 
this can only be detected if controls undertaken are more rigorous 
it should be our goal to ensure that port state controls are not superficial but include materials testing 
if it should become apparent that one or more classification companies have provided reports by way of favours then they should be struck off the list of authorised classification companies 
that is the only deterrent we have for preventing other classification companies from following suit 
there are reputable companies too 
you will be familiar with some reputable companies our french fellow meps will be familiar with some reputable companies but we must look carefully at exactly which companies do not fulfil requirements and these must be struck off the list 
finally we should make it quite plain to malta that if it wants to become a member of this community then by the time it accedes it must apply a standard in respect of registration and flag state control which completely fulfils our requirements for the environment is a communal entity and not something that we can divide up 
mr president commissioner the erika sank near my home and is still there with tonnes in its hold the fate of which we are waiting to discover 
it could have sunk anywhere 
it happened to sink there and brittany where i come from should not apologise for the fact that geography has made it a peninsula and the result is that it is often forced to clear up after shipwrecks 
my first thoughts are for the indian sailors who were saved but of whom nothing has been said 
by now they are far away 
it is a miracle that they were saved 
so we are now experiencing the same thing that happened years ago with the amoco cadiz a wreck on the north coast a wreck on the south coast a wreck on the west coast 
things could well continue in the same way 
commissioner as time is very short i would like to pick out the seven points which we feel and you have already mentioned some of them are essential to work on double-hulled vessels in our waters as soon as possible and the strictest possible state control of ports 
in particular we must ensure that classification societies are compelled to make their reports public as currently we do not have access to them 
then sanctions must be harmonised between the member states they should not be different but the same throughout the union 
we must be tougher on vessels flying flags of convenience not because they are necessarily bad boats but because amongst these boats there are many bad ones 
we must also target those responsible and take a tougher line with them 
with regard to this matter i would like to know who owns the erika because the idea of a legal person under our law is one thing but there are always real shareholders in the background 
perhaps they are in lovely villas by lovely beaches getting a nice tan 
we would like to know their names and their faces 
finally there must be improvements in the training of crews 
in our society there is no such thing as zero-risk but we must at least ensure the greatest possible levels of safety 
mr president i welcome the statement from the commissioner 
having spent a lot of time at sea myself i am well aware of the sea's power and destructive force which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential 
i would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker erika 
this has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources 
it should be noted that the oil industry through the international oil pollution compensation funds regards itself as liable under the convention and its protocol for over % of the estimated cost of this incident or some usd million 
this suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility 
however before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented 
better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals 
in that context i support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection 
i support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels' structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions 
calls for design improvements in hull construction especially double-hulled vessels are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet 
they are no substitute for rigorous regular inspection 
mr president i would like to thank my socialist colleagues mainly in the committees on transport and the environment who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing industry 
because as well as the irreparable damage to the environment the damage to the ecosystem and losses in the tourist industry the oil slick dealt a huge blow to the fishing industry to the conservation of marine resources and the damaged coast lines will take years to recover 
it is no accident commissioner that the affected areas are always those european regions which are least developed those which eke out a meagre existence from tourism and fishing and which in the majority of cases do not have any other resources 
these are the same areas commissioner which already have to put up with the disrespectful activities of certain shipowners who empty the bilges of their vessels off their coasts without any control whatsoever 
i come from a region galicia which has suffered similar accidents in the past 
i therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways 
on the one hand by asking the commission within the scope of aid to the fishing industry to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected and also by asking them to demand of international bodies and of themselves tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience 
on the other hand prevention is essential 
portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea 
i would ask the portuguese presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at european level using all the means at our disposal technological structural and socio-economic to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future 
lastly mr president i would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities who reminded me of old times when as the then mayoress i lived through similar situations 
we must thank those who while defenceless and lacking in resources have battled courageously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions the marine ecosystem and european fishing stocks 
mr president as chairman of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism i should like to congratulate the commission and in particular commissioner loyola de palacio for her reaction to this incident which has really shaken the whole of europe 
we as the committee on transport are prepared to discuss the commission communication on the question of safety at sea and of course we are likewise prepared to discuss at a later date the legal implications of this communication 
first the commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of rina the italian shipping register because we need to know if community law was applied 
that should be the starting point for our efforts 
secondly apart from the shipowners' liability it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and of course for restoring the damage 
once we have done that our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified 
i have no objection to examining an amendment making community law stricter but as other members have stressed we need to start with application because there is already a legal framework at european union level and we must not lose sight of that fact 
this legal framework is fairly advanced at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the member states under the supervision of the commission should endeavour to ensure that community law is actually applied 
the erika catastrophe comes as no surprise 
i do not know precisely how many but any number of ships which are practically floating time bombs in european waters sail every day and as far as i can see a catastrophe of this kind could happen again any day 
it all revolves around the ships the technology the equipment we are talking about the ports how they are organised and what they have to say for themselves and of course it is all about teamwork 
we know full well where the opposition to every single solitary legislative measure has come from in the course of the last few years 
it always came from the member states from the council of ministers where they fought doggedly over every trifling matter achieving very little in terms of progress 
if we expect car-owning citizens to have a clean bill of health themselves and to fulfil the legal personal requirements and also have their cars regularly inspected then it ought to be possible for the same to apply to ships 
control is the key word here 
is it really pure coincidence that to a lesser or greater extent it is always the same states that allow these ships to fly under their flags 
so why is there no black list 
if there are dangerous death traps in european waters then why do we not say as is the case elsewhere that these should not be allowed to enter european waters and call at european ports 
therefore what i would really like to see in your catalogue of measures for the summer is overall inspections for all tankers currently sailing in european waters and i would also like an update on what the member states have actually subscribed to and indeed implemented so far in the way of imo regulations and conventions for there is still some dragging of feet there 
what happened to erika cannot be put down to sloppy work but as far as i am concerned to collective criminal responsibility and we in parliament will have the opportunity in the course of the next few months to demonstrate in the case of one matter in particular whether we are taking this seriously 
i am referring to port reception installations a matter for the member states 
this will come up for discussion again and when it does i hope that we will all still hold the same opinions as we do today 
mr president commissioner i believe that the unfortunate incident involving the erika should in fact as others have said this afternoon constitute a decisive watershed which will see the end to this type of accident in the european union where since there have been seventeen accidents involving large oil tankers more than one every two years 
the economic and social damage which we have spoken about today in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the community institutions 
commissioner i would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented 
i trust that these measures will in a few months give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument a directive possibly which will put an end once and for all to these century pirates who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea 
i would like to comment on one of the measures to be taken which was mentioned by the commissioner and some of my colleagues 
i am referring to the double hull which consists of two layers of steel with containers divided into two tanks 
commissioner i believe that it is time to opt for the safest technically possible measures 
it is therefore not sufficient to merely reproduce the legislation in force in other countries 
i believe that we can and must improve the existing legislation in this regard 
any cost-benefit analysis which truly takes into account all the harm occasioned to persons and the environment by these accidents is bound to support this approach 
mr president commissioner i think that first we should all congratulate ourselves on the procedure that has been adopted and which will lead us after each of our respective political groups has rallied together and expressed its feelings finally to produce a joint resolution 
i think that given the dramatic circumstances and as a matter of principle it would be ill-advised and inappropriate to hold several votes 
on the other hand parliament is issuing a resolution in one vote for which we can see the agreement amongst the various speakers who have preceded me 
i think that this is an opportunity to put parliamentary pressure on the doubts or evasions of a few governments and i think that we are providing the commission with a powerful political act for the preparation of a european maritime area 
i think that it is quite obvious and this is the first conclusion that can be drawn from the erika disaster that public opinion would find it hard to understand that we regulate chocolate but do not regulate maritime transport 
public opinion would find it hard to understand that we talk about a common judicial area common airspace a common rail area and a single market but not a common maritime area 
i therefore believe that this is a project which must be opened up with the absolute will to see it followed through and followed through in concrete terms 
the commissioner has suggested three main chapters which need to be drafted and brought into line with our legislation in which we can set standards 
i have also noted to my great satisfaction that even the groups advocating greater national sovereignty or the eurosceptic groups are calling for europe to regulate and i think that this is in fact the right level to take action 
we sometimes regulate things which could by and large remain subsidiary 
in this area we must respond to public opinion 
this is extremely important and everyone should feel concerned because we are when all is said and done on the global scale merely a peninsula 
therefore once our legislation has been brought into line we must follow this up immediately with appropriate law 
i have almost finished and i would like to say that i have personally requested a public hearing of the committee on transport which would enable us to provide an immediate follow-up to the erika case and to suggest possible future considerations 
i hope that all political groups will support us in our request for a public hearing 
mr president the oil tanker erika the ownership of which is veiled by accommodation addresses on malta and probably in italy and greece and which was hired by total-fina for the transport of oil foundered off the breton coastline with disastrous consequences 
the implications for the environment and for the flora and fauna of the european maritime environment are enormous 
the cause of the disaster must be sought in the weakened structure of the oil tanker 
so people are doubtful about the safety of ships which carry dangerous or polluting goods 
the international maritime organisation has issued international rules in this connection 
states can carry out port inspections 
in europe legislation is stricter and it is compulsory to inspect % of the incoming vessels according to the port-state control directive 
however it seems that none of the member states meets this figure due to a lack of inspectors 
it is clear that there is no lack of legislation 
in my opinion the commissioner is quite right 
where the scheme falters is in the enforcement of existing legislation 
but how are we now going to enforce this if there is indeed a lack of inspectors esteemed european commission 
should its implementation not be more strictly monitored 
in short to give priority to older sub-standard ships over ships which meet all quality requirements 
the erika was built at a japanese shipyard and is single-hulled 
there are four more sister ships in service at present 
construction of this type of ship was halted at the time because the risk of rusting was especially high 
some of them also sail under the maltese flag 
are we waiting for the next accident to happen 
would sanctions not be appropriate as the commissioner stated for the classification society 
rina is currently the talk of the town 
malta is entering the accession negotiations 
in my opinion the european union can only accept malta if it is guaranteed that the maltese flag will sail without an accident in future 
i would be grateful if you could be disciplined since we are running out of time and this delay is going to limit the time available for questions to the commission 
like many other hundreds of volunteers she had seen the destruction washed birds and cleaned up after the people responsible who were not to be found on the coast on those evenings and nights when they really should have been required to be there 
like so many others i too wonder where the people responsible are 
where are the shipowners and those who order the shipments when these disasters occur 
perhaps it might be time for us to begin to consider establishing a common environmental authority which could deal with this type of crime 
this is not the first time we have seen oil slicks whether intentional or unintentional 
i would like to thank mrs grossetête and her colleagues for bringing this motion before parliament 
the environmental disaster of the sinking of the erika off brittany and the spillage of tonnes of oil has been widely reported in the british media 
although britain and france have had their differences recently i can assure you that there is considerable sympathy in my country for all those affected 
tv pictures of the damage done to your coastline and wildlife in particular birds and the already dwindling fish stocks have brought back memories of similar british disasters such as the torrey canyon in and have prompted many british volunteers to help 
i salute these joint efforts to repair the damage 
this is clearly a problem for all eu coastlines which will require imaginative solutions 
instead of allowing the costs of these disasters to fall on the communities most affected and insurance markets such as lloyds of london we must develop new technologies to retrieve from the sea much more than % of the lost oil 
there is currently little financial incentive for this when the insurance market picks up the tab 
ultimately the polluter must pay 
in addition we must build on the council directive dealing with enforcement of international standards for ship safety and pollution prevention by ensuring that the inspection goal of % of ships calling at eu ports is met and that a high standard of inspection is delivered 
moreover although i am not opposed to shipowners registering their vessels in their country of choice i believe there is a need for stricter application of international regulations 
rather than banning flags of convenience which would violate the right of every sovereign state to have a merchant fleet under the eu directive on port state control national maritime authorities must impose more effective sanctions on flag states which fail to carry out their international treaty obligations 
i sincerely hope that particularly during the french presidency later this year the commission and the council will look carefully at all these options and i heartily commend this resolution to parliament 
mr president it feels quite strange to be standing here again today as i have been doing at regular intervals for almost ten years and all because of an accident caused by human hand and by a lack of human competence and not by force majeure 
the victims are waiting outside 
they want answers 
they do not want any more promises that we then fail to keep or to see any efforts that we then fail to follow through 
the citizens are right to ask do our regions now count amongst those which are lost forever 
who will provide us with new jobs 
when will those responsible at last understand that sparing resources is not something we do for fun nor is it just a question of creating a system for its own sake or a new study group rather it is a joint european challenge 
it is equally important to note that prevention is better than cure 
but there is an art to that as well 
deploying the german multipurpose ship neuwerk it is right outside my front door in cuxhaven entailed the swift provision of european neighbourly help 
we are particularly in the debt of those who undertook the difficult deployment of all their crew 
valuable experiences were gained and also the knowledge that we cannot master such environmental disasters using state-of-the-art technology alone 
we are therefore right to demand improved controls sanctions and preventive measures 
i have been fighting for a european environmental coastguard service for almost ten years here in parliament 
the issue is as topical as it was before 
furthermore i will not withhold my support but will endeavour alongside my fellow meps to bring about improvements and logical solutions within the framework of european and international cooperation 
before the end of march i propose to present a communication in which i will possibly present legislative texts that is to say amendments of specific directives so that discussions may begin in the council and in parliament 
i would like to tell you that in fact it is not just an environmental problem it is a very important environmental problem but it is also a very important social problem 
there are men and women who depend on fishing gathering shellfish and the service or tourist industries in these coastal areas 
they are environmentally sensitive areas but they are also sensitive from the point of view of social development and territorial equilibrium 
and therefore we must take the utmost care to prevent the recurrence of a similar situation 
mrs roth-behrendt said that nothing had ever been done 
in fact i believe that things have been done by the commission but there is still more to do 
this was demonstrated by the americans who after the exxon valdez disaster within one year adopted enormously rigorous and tough legislation which threatens as i said earlier to divert ships unacceptable to american ports towards europe 
in europe after the amoco cadiz or the urquiola on the spanish coast in or the torrey canyon in the same year or the many other cases there have been we really began to legislate after and particularly in the last few years 
during these years the emphasis has mainly been on the safety of passenger transport 
that is the reality 
in my opinion we now have to make a significant and urgent effort to confront new problems also deriving from american legislation which emphasise the safety of the transport of dangerous goods in the maritime sector 
i have referred to a series of issues which i will lay out in more detail if you wish in an appearance before a special committee on this matter or when i present the actual initiatives in the coming months 
my intention is and i insist for us to begin discussions after the end of march also coinciding with the council of ministers and of course before the end of the six-month period of the portuguese presidency for us to have texts to discuss 
flags of convenience are one problem but are not the only one 
the romanian flag is not a flag of convenience but nevertheless that country has an extremely high number of incidences at inspections more than the countries with flags of convenience 
malta and cyprus have asked to join the community 
we must be demanding on this issue and we are negotiating to this end 
this will oblige us to reconsider the registers in the european union and to deal with the notorious problem which will no doubt arise again of the aim of a community register 
i believe that this will be difficult but in any event we should carry out a review of the registers of the european union countries 
as for the inspections very much a key question the first thing we have to consider is how the current legislation has worked as mr hatzidakis has said 
we already have legislation 
according to the information which the commission services have given me this legislation is not adequately applied in many member states due to a lack of personnel means and inspectors 
the problem is not that only % are inspected but rather how we select how we find the ships which constitute the highest risk through the age of the ships and the risk history of the flags 
unfortunately the % often consists of flags which are expected to fulfil the requirements in this way inspections are quicker and the work is carried out more easily 
therefore more than making amendments we will have to implement measures to control what is already being done apart from some supplementary requirements with regard to reviews especially in relation to the age of the different vessels 
with regard to the question of union inspectors i believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies the idea that these inspections be carried out by the member states which does not mean that the commission does not have to ensure that the states carry out their duty adequately 
lastly i would like to stress the issue of liability 
not only in terms of maximum sums insured which i believe should be similar to those in the united states 
we have set a figure of usd million in the united states they are talking about usd billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments 
i believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the united states but that we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and therefore the liability of shipowners and also to hold liable those who charter ships which is to say the owners of the cargo 
unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable we will never in my opinion resolve these problems 
i will end now 
i will not expand further 
we will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions 
but obviously as some speakers have said and i thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions we cannot allow a situation where within one two or three years we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done 
as for me i can say after having debated it in the college of commissioners that the commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures amendments and directives to parliament and the council in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety 
the political will of this parliament is required and i can see that i can count on this as well as that of the council of ministers 
thank you very much commissioner 
we have taken good note of your intentions 
the debate is closed 
the vote will take place on thursday at p.m 
the next item is the commission statement on the storms in europe 
mr barnier has the floor on behalf of the commission 
mr president ladies and gentlemen you have just been speaking about the human ecological and social consequences of yet another oil slick which has reached french shores 
we are now speaking and personally i am very happy that we are about the consequences of an historic storm a veritable hurricane which affected france and also the federal republic of germany and austria in the same period 
when speaking about the consequences of such accidents or such terrible weather conditions we are not only talking about the damage to the environment and to property we are also talking and this is a point i wish to make too about the consequences of the storm as well as of the oil slick for men women and families who as mrs de palacio said a moment ago are seriously traumatised wounded bruised demoralised the weakest of which are desperate 
i have seen this myself 
i really think that today we are seeing an expression of european solidarity a solidarity demonstrated by words of moral support but which is above all human 
this is the solidarity that i would like to express on behalf of the whole commission and particularly within the commission on behalf of my colleagues who have not forgotten their roots or their citizenship franz fischler from austria michaele schreyer and günther verheugen from germany and pascal lamy and myself from france 
this expression of feeling is to complement that already shown by the national authorities of these countries and by the tremendous surge of generosity and kindness that has been shown 
and as we are talking about europe i would also like to take my hat off to the spontaneity and the willingness of the volunteers from the public electricity and telephone services to the firemen and the road-workers who came spontaneously from all over europe to help to re-open roads and to restore electricity and telephones 
in some parts of france some families have only had their telephones and electricity working again since yesterday or the day before 
at the request of president prodi the commission has held its first talks on this whole issue a discussion during its first meeting of the year and now as the president asked us to i would like to tell you the results of our work to provide every response that the union can muster in terms of rebuilding those parts of our economic social and cultural heritage that were affected 
this must be done within the limits of the regulations and the budget having expressed our human and moral solidarity 
ladies and gentlemen the commission will therefore make use of every instrument it has in order to help the affected member states in this reconstruction and to provide any possible aid to the people and businesses affected 
this will be done in order to complement and to top up the support and aid which have already been decided on by the national and regional authorities 
as you know the commission has several instruments and tools which can provide aid for this rehabilitation and reconstruction effort and we intend to use all of these instruments with the same desire to help which mrs de palacio expressed when she spoke of the lessons to be learned from the erika disaster 
as far as the structural policy is concerned i am personally going to look into how we can use the current decisions on the new generation of strategies for economic development which will be implemented over the next seven years 
i will also look into how the appropriations which have already been allocated particularly to regions of rural industrial and urban conversion and to fishing areas that is all the regions covered by objective can help this reconstruction 
the objective zoning was stopped by the commission after consulting the various governments 
a preliminary study by the commission services shows that on the basis of a financial allocation set up in proportion to the eligible population % of people affected by the storm may benefit from aid eligible under objective 
the devastated french departments could thus receive around eur billion over the next seven years 
for germany and austria the corresponding total sums are respectively eur billion for germany and eur million for austria 
i would also like to point out that the devastated areas which do not feature on this new zoning plan and unfortunately there are some which are not covered by objective but which were eligible under the previous objective and objective zoning could also have access to appropriations available in the new programming period as provisional support 
i would therefore like to suggest the most straightforward way in which structural appropriations could broadly contribute to the economic rehabilitation of devastated areas 
of course it is not a question of providing emergency aid since as you know very well two years ago the meagre appropriations available in the european budget under emergency aid were discontinued 
it is a question of repair and lasting restoration in the context of the programmes currently in preparation and this in my view is our most important task 
powers for programming actions and selecting priorities have as you know been devolved to each state 
each government will therefore under the conditions that i have just stated have to establish its priorities and make choices 
they will probably have new priorities in order to take into account the consequences of this storm or of the oil slick 
it is up to the governments of the countries concerned to distribute community financial support among the various regions eligible for structural funds and therefore to propose to the commission plans for action to be carried out at grass roots level 
in order to be more specific though by way of an example i would like to remind you that all of these programmes in devastated areas will be able to finance the restoration of our historical and cultural heritage areas of economic activity and industrial or trading areas 
they could also finance the channels necessary for the flow of raw materials and industrial products for port infrastructures both commercial and leisure ports the infrastructure of airports involved in business travel or tourism productive industrial investments aid to businesses and historical and cultural heritage for tourism as well as training for employees qualified under the european social fund 
the commission is therefore entirely at the disposal of each of the member states in order to adapt to rearrange this programming to the best effect 
i would like to stress that this also applies to those who suffered the effects of the other storms at the beginning of december in denmark the united kingdom and in sweden 
i know that parliament adopted a previous resolution to this effect on december last year 
i hope you do not mind if i stress even though i have already said it twice that this applies to greece too with regard to the consequences of the earthquake which occurred at the beginning of september in accordance with objective of the cohesion fund 
ladies and gentlemen my colleague franz fischler adopts the same approach with regard to rural development 
france will therefore benefit by eur million per year germany by eur million and austria by eur million 
this aid is available for devastated regions and is not constrained by the zoning which i am bound to apply under objective 
of the measures eligible under the eaggf guarantee section i would like to mention restoring agricultural and forestry production potential which has been damaged reforestation infrastructures for country roads and infrastructures for prevention and protection such as dykes and warning systems 
in this context probably the most special case is that of the timber industry which has been affected particularly badly by these storms and to which we will be devoting all our attention in both economic and environmental terms 
i would like to say that the eaggf could also allocate a community cofinancing grant for the storage of wood 
furthermore in the fisheries sector it is also possible to employ the structural instruments for cofinancing grants 
france would thus have access to eur million for the period 
community aid will thus be able to contribute to compensating fishermen and boat-owners for the temporary cessation of their activities in case of unforeseen events up to a maximum of two months per year 
it is also conceivable that the financial instrument for fisheries guidance fifg will be able to provide assistance which could be used for standard investment projects 
i am thinking here of fish-farming equipment community facilities restructuring developing fish-farming sites equipping fishing harbours modernising boats and i have already discussed these matters with franz fischler 
finally following consultation of course with my colleague mario monti the commission would like to underline the fact that state aid earmarked for making good the damage caused by natural disasters or other extraordinary events can be considered compatible with the common market 
it would therefore in these circumstances be authorised by the commission 
we can then embark on various courses of action straight away for example in the area of energy within the framework of the trans-european energy networks 
i know that where the transmission of energy is concerned there are many technical problems particularly in the transmission of very high voltage energy 
nevertheless looking back to my quite recent time as minister for the environment in france when i campaigned for underground lines i would like to point out as one of you did a while ago that in this area as in many others prevention is much cheaper than a cure 
i therefore hope that the member states will vote in favour of laying telegraph telephone and electricity networks underground when this is technically possible and that they are encouraged to do so 
and that ladies and gentlemen covers the community instruments which offer many opportunities for very practical intervention 
the european union does not and will not do everything 
it can nevertheless do a great deal on condition that we are able to make use of these instruments that you keep us informed and that member states are able in the days following these storms to set out their priorities and to make choices 
it is therefore very important that this house as well as the commission passes this information and this practical expression of solidarity on to all partners involved and to the people concerned and affected 
as far as i am concerned i shall endeavour to do that myself this week when i visit the day after tomorrow two french departments which have been particularly badly affected by the storms charente-maritime affected both by the hurricane and the oil slick and creuse 
with thanks for your patience i should like to conclude this presentation mr president by mentioning a subject close to my heart 
this is one of the lessons we should learn from these disasters which do not always have natural causes but which often do 
the commission already has a unit for the coordination of civil protection for which my colleague margot wallström is responsible 
this unit i might add worked well when it had to deal with the oil slick to find boats arrange protection for beaches machines for cleaning oil-covered birds to the extent that it is possible 
the resources of european countries were employed here a fact which is sometimes forgotten and which justifies the tribute i wanted to pay to the spontaneous solidarity shown by all european countries 
nevertheless i think that we must go even further 
president prodi margot wallström and i are convinced that we need to find a more systematic way of developing a european intervention strategy which is based on existing mechanisms in each country on specialised units such as fire brigades vaccination and civil protection teams mountain rescue dog teams and many more 
members of these units whilst staying in their own countries would undergo a common course of training 
if needed they could be mobilised both within the european union as we have seen with this storm and the earthquake in greece and outside the union as happened in the cases of turkey and south and central america following the tragic events that have taken place there 
this really is an opportunity to create a genuine european civil protection force 
for the moment of course the commission has neither the manpower nor the financial resources to take responsibility for such a task 
we think though that with margot wallström and under the authority of president romano prodi this is one of the lessons that we will be learning from this series of disasters natural or otherwise which have had such tragic consequences 
in terms of efficiency and also of political clarity this task force would be a symbol of our idea of the european union 
as far as i am concerned i intend within the commission to promote this idea as one of the lessons to be learned from this disaster 
mr president the last days of were swept away by an incredibly violent storm which struck france in the main but also affected germany spain great britain and switzerland 
i am sad to say that it accounted for more than deaths of which occurred in france 
the human cost has been enormous but so has the material damage and both public amenities and private property have been destroyed or seriously damaged 
millions of homes are without electricity telephones or running water 
economic activities have been brought to a halt 
in france alone insurance companies are already estimating the costs of the damages at a total of ff billion which is between eur and billion 
this is why i would like to thank all of those who gave a hand to the emergency services and to the authorities and public services which were overwhelmed by the magnitude of the task 
thank you everyone from the bottom of my heart for this invaluable help 
now that the shock has passed and the authorities' vital functions have been re-established i wonder and i ask the commission and the council to consider as well the opportunity once again to incorporate a budget line for emergency aid into the community budget in order to address this kind of occurrence 
the risks of weather-related disasters must not be ignored and in the light of the consequences of such disasters and the speed of intervention that they require i think that the community would do well to have these resources again 
it should be possible to release the emergency aid that we once had from the strict rules applied to the structural funds 
it is obvious that the answer to the question i am asking about re-establishing community emergency aid must be yes 
next i would like to address the huge problems encountered by one industry that has been particularly badly affected by this storm 
i am talking about the forestry sector whose business has been seriously damaged by the havoc that the terrible weather wrought on the forests 
it must be understood that forests are not just landscape or environmental features 
they also represent a major socio-economic sector in some regions and this should not be overlooked 
in france more than million cubic metres of wood were brought down by the wind 
this represents around three years' full harvest for producers 
the consequences of this have been immediate 
some foresters have lost everything 
entire areas of forest have been devastated which will in a few weeks cause security and fire-fighting problems 
prices have already fallen because of the huge availability of timber which has led to market saturation 
infrastructures will suffer as a result of the abnormal volume of heavy goods vehicles logging and handling gear on the roads 
in these circumstances it is crucial that we re-establish access routes restore the land and implement technical solutions which will enable us to refit storage areas and prop up timber prices 
in the long term we will have to reforest with all the resources we can muster 
this is a whole raft of measures which should be adopted mr president and i am delighted at the indications which the commissioner gave even though he knows that not everything is eligible under objective 
médoc is not commissioner and i hope that given the circumstances the eaggf will be able to replace objective 
mr president commissioner parliament must not consider the unusually violent storms which have raged across various european regions to be a normal occurrence 
it is certainly a tragic one but it must be seen as something exceptional 
on the contrary these storms and their consequences are political events of major importance 
how so 
why is this not an exceptional matter 
firstly because we now know that the occurrence of this kind of climatic phenomenon is never entirely unpredictable 
we now know that this kind of storm is often related to phenomena of climate change and to greenhouse effect phenomena with regard to which our citizens are waiting for the european union to develop a comprehensive strategy of studies and forecasts 
this means of course that today we must send out a powerful message of solidarity to everyone affected by the storm and to the families that have lost a loved one 
i would like to reiterate that we deplore the death of at least people during this storm 
this message must go to the craftsmen who have lost their work tools to the farmers who have seen years of hard work disappear in a few minutes and to everyone who saw in the century in the cold and by candlelight 
with regard to this i am delighted at the work that has been done in recent days in this house between the various political groups in order to reach a joint resolution which i hope will be adopted tomorrow 
but in specific terms and going beyond fine words this solidarity must obviously be translated into a major mobilisation of finances which will enable us to set about rebuilding the devastated economic sectors the destroyed communications networks and quite simply to provide people with decent living conditions once again 
i understand that some of the devastated areas were eligible under the community structural funds and that everything possible will be done to mobilise them as quickly as possible 
i would like to say though that this is not sufficient 
it is not sufficient because the reallocation of these ongoing appropriations simply towards making good the damage penalises long-term projects for investment and development already in place 
above all i think that public opinion will see this solution as unacceptable in terms of our political responsibility to europe 
our fellow citizens do not understand why the european union is able to release considerable sums of aid in exceptional emergency conditions to help third countries which have suffered natural disasters even if this aid is quite legitimate 
from now on if we want to ensure that europe is not perceived by our citizens to be a machine churning out complex and pernickety regulations this is something we must change 
we have to come up with a new budgetary mechanism which will enable us eventually to raise sufficient funds in the event of an emergency and in the light of the great logistical and human mobilisation which we saw with specialists coming from all over europe 
we must effectively facilitate the creation of a europe-wide civil protection body 
it is only when times are hard that we recognise our fellow human beings and appreciate their solidarity and i think that this is the price of building a citizens' europe 
commissioner i would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the european union in terms of the help that we can offer them 
in the days immediately following this terrible storm i wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the french authorities to redraw the boundaries of objective so that all areas devastated by the storms in france and elsewhere could benefit from objective 
i think that you must have done so because you have not mentioned it 
in fact we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an objective region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid 
we should therefore put this situation right immediately 
you also know that this will not only be a short-term problem but also a medium and long-term one 
let me explain 
i was in the region of lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around % of deciduous forest 
we know for example that it takes between and years for a tree to reach maturity so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one two or five years but over many more 
the towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over years 
i think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues 
i think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies 
it is true that the problem of the forestry sector is an extremely complex one 
indeed you spoke of releasing funds for timber storage on the grounds that its price must not depreciate 
on the other hand districts which have not been affected by the storms will also suffer as the national forestry office has decided to freeze cuts in forestation for four years 
those districts which have not suffered losses will therefore see their incomes decrease in any case 
i am telling you all of this to illustrate how complex the problem is and i thank the commission once again for extending their analysis of this situation as far as it could 
i would also like to draw your attention to the fact that although there has indeed been an economic disaster the real ecological catastrophes are still to come 
as you yourself said commissioner these disasters or storms do not always have natural causes and we think that these are the first signs of climate change 
we should therefore review our policies in order to take account of this fact 
mr president commissioner france is still in shock as a result of this terrible disaster which has caused the death of dozens of people 
no sector has been spared road air rail ports electricity and telephone infrastructures homes school buildings and historic monuments not forgetting of course agriculture and forestry which have been devastated in many regions 
people may have been traumatised in the areas where the damage has been greatest but nobody has given up in the face of these terrible circumstances 
in the days immediately following the storms a fantastic spirit of solidarity and generosity developed and still exists 
elected representatives municipal employees citizens of france and of all europe have rallied round to offer their help 
i would like to pay special tribute to the commitment and the devotion of the public service employees who gave freely of their own time with the sole aim of helping those affected to re-establish normality with regard to electricity transport telephones and the utilities 
at this testing time demonstrating their efficiency the public services have reminded everybody how essential they are to the life of our society 
i think that this should give us pause particularly with a view to halting the current process of deregulation and privatisation 
it is of course also crucial to tend to wounds to make preparations for reconstruction and repair while learning all the lessons that this terrible disaster has to teach us 
i clearly heard what commissioner barnier was saying and indeed i appreciate his proposals but personally i would not set emergency goals and long-term goals in opposition to one another 
on the contrary i think that the situation shows in hindsight the relevance of the proposal my group made to restore a specific budget line for natural disasters in the union 
it would also be appropriate of course to increase the structural funds for reconstruction in regions which have been devastated particularly appropriations for rural development for agro-food measures and for forestry 
i took particular note of the proposals concerning objective 
finally the idea that this type of disaster is connected to climate change due to the consequences of human activity upon the environment has been advanced 
if this idea were to be confirmed the european union would have to make considerably more effort to ensure that the commitments given at the kyoto conference are respected 
it should also make protection of the planet a priority rather than the unbridled pursuit of profit 
mr president everyone who has travelled here by car train or aeroplane has been able to see the extent of the damage particularly in france caused by hurricanes of a completely unprecedented violence which struck europe at the end of last month 
what can the members of the european parliament do when faced with such a widespread disaster 
firstly i would like to pay tribute to the mayors and local representatives who on a daily basis have had to reassure their constituents organise volunteers and cooperate with the public services 
they have earned the confidence of their fellow-citizens 
i would also like to consider the paradoxical situation we have with regard to emergency aid 
if this disaster had taken place in guatemala or turkey we could have immediately used the community budget to help the victims but in our own countries nothing of the kind is possible because there is no suitable budget line with which to do so 
we must also ask the commission not to prevent local authorities and individual states from coming to the assistance of businesses affected by the disaster by applying community competition rules too strictly 
i am thinking in particular here of fish and shellfish companies which have been particularly badly hit 
as you said commissioner we must ensure that there is compensation for the forced cessation in activity and that appeals can be made to fifg for investments that have been totally wiped out 
beyond this i think that implementing magps in a mechanical way will no longer be appropriate in the coastal regions that have been affected 
i therefore ask the commission to stop doing so and on the contrary to help those who make their living from the sea to proceed to new investments which they urgently need 
mr president the storms which devastated france during the night between and december have caused as has been said deaths and damage to a value of ff billion i.e eur billion 
almost three weeks after the disaster several thousand people were still without electricity and telephones hectares of forestry land or million cubic metres of forest have been ruined and our historical heritage has also been affected as the sad example of the park at the palace of versailles demonstrates 
it seems quite natural that given such a disaster national and european solidarity should go to the help of the devastated regions and those people who have been worst affected 
as the previous speakers have said and as you said commissioner in response to my fellow member mr martinez with regard to another tragedy the floods in november in the southwest of france you have certainly noted these disasters with concern but all you are doing is pointing out that the budget line for emergency appropriations for natural disasters has been discontinued which has resulted in this shocking paradox 
this paradox pointed out by the previous speaker is that it is easier a great deal easier to offer help to victims of natural disasters outside the union than within it 
we know full well that what you are doing commissioner and that is limiting yourself to giving us the hypothetical and remote possibility of benefiting from the structural funds of the new objective or from the provisional objectives or 
these are the terms of the written answer you gave mr martinez on january 
i can show you a copy if you wish 
we would understand completely if you were not able to say anything else given the irresponsible attitude not only of the commission but also of this parliament and if you cannot do anything because there is no legal or financial framework for doing so 
as a matter of urgency therefore we must restore within the framework of a supplementary budget the budget line which was allocated to us for natural disasters 
we must use the berlin summit aid appropriations and we must change the forestry policy implemented in most countries in the union 
that however is another problem altogether 
mr president commissioner europe has undergone a tough ordeal at the start of this millennium 
i would first like to express my heartfelt condolences to the families in mourning as a result of the appalling weather conditions that devastated europe in december 
these storms were an unprecedented ecological disaster for our forests 
i hope you do not mind if i make particular mention of the forests in my region lorraine which have suffered enormous destruction 
i would like to congratulate the regional authorities the volunteers and the public services on the fantastic way in which they rallied round but unfortunately their troubles are not yet over 
it is europe's duty to support them and thereby complement the efforts of the governments of member states affected by the disaster 
i am certainly not forgetting the economic dimension of this matter as the timber industry has been devastated and a whole population is suffering the tragic effects of this 
the community action programme for civil protection established by a council decision on december was launched on january 
i ask member states to grasp this opportunity 
this programme must work at full capacity 
our priority as we wait for community-level funds to be freed up is for material aid in terms of partnership exchanges between member states 
it is therefore a matter of urgency to improve forest roads and to repair them as quickly as possible 
lending forestry equipment and making personnel qualified in forestry management available are also covered by this measure 
our next challenge will be to prevent the occurrence of phytosanitary problems which could result from having to abandon large amounts of wood in the forest and from the pollution of ground water through having to store such large quantities of wood 
finally it is essential that we slow down the logging of standing wood in order to give priority to the purchase of windfalls 
these timber sales should be supported by strong media coverage in member states 
this aid for gathering timber is of course only the first stage of an aid package which will take the form of aid for reforestation and aid for the development of rural areas 
i ask the commission to incorporate this into a study of how the situation should be managed now that the emergency is over 
this is a very sad opportunity for europe to renew its forestry heritage in line with the role that this plays in wildlife and nature conservation and in our economies 
it is therefore a time for solidarity and cooperation between member states in the face of an ecological and economic calamity 
if this solidarity is to have been worthwhile it is up to europe to propose priority actions for safeguarding the timber industry 
hurricane lothar should prompt us not to abide solely by the principle of undertaking repairs once the damage is done something which is discussed at a very superficial level here but to switch to the precautionary principle under the terms of which potential perpetrators are brought to book too 
current programmes must be accelerated 
the trade in emissions rights is immoral to my mind and rather than solving the problem it shelves it 
the entire taxation system must be given an environmental perspective in the medium term 
we must work more rapidly towards achieving the targets stipulated in the white paper for renewable energy sources as this would bring about a massive reduction in greenhouse gases 
the new commission has not put forward nearly enough on this subject and what it has put forward is woefully inadequate 
commissioner mr president lothar was a quite ordinary name hitherto 
however it has now achieved notoriety 
the hurricane of the same name swept across europe claiming numerous victims mainly in france and germany but also in switzerland leaving a trail of destruction in its wake 
the wind triumphed over electricity pylons roofs traffic signs and ultimately over the forest 
we have heard that in a short space of time the storm left us with approximately million cubic metres of solid timber and this is only an estimate 
i have listened to you very attentively commissioner and welcome with open arms the fact that you are intending to go and see for yourself the effects the catastrophe has had in france and in germany 
if mrs schreyer is to visit the black forest sometime in the next few days then any one farmer might ask her how the commission and europe would be able to help him as an individual 
what would you say to the forestry manager if his enterprise happened not to be in an objective region or in a region 
what answer will the commission give when it is on the scene when you tell the forestry worker that we support road construction and dam-building and we want to rebuild our cultural heritage and create tourist attractions etc 
all this is well-intentioned advice 
however i come from an area in northern germany where the forestry industry predominates and i can tell you that we are already feeling the effects of the immense damage 
the thinning-out we need is not being attended to the forests are not being tended to the requisite degree 
what we need the commission to do as a matter of urgency is to approve national aid so as to avoid the competition issue being raised again at a later date 
mr president commissioner permit me first of all to make reference to two facts 
firstly at the beginning of nato with the participation of most member states of the european union flattened kosovo with bombs in the name of freedom 
we are now endeavouring at huge cost to get the country back on its feet again and help its people and rightly so 
secondly at the end of unbelievable storms raged bringing death and destruction to vast tracts of the eu 
the commission in brussels responded to the victims' cries for help with a shrugging of shoulders 
we do not have the wherewithal for that they said 
this is wrong 
and no one can comprehend this attitude 
certainly those who fear for their livelihood are at a complete loss 
the citizens of the european union expect solidarity also from within this community 
i say they have a right to solidarity 
indeed the european parliament must make it its business to uphold this right in hours of need 
i urge the commission not to keep having to be asked and to provide assistance for the victims of the storms 
it knows the ins and outs of aid provision better than any local organisation or authority 
i call upon you ladies and gentlemen to support me in bringing home to the commission the fact that what most brussels offices are lacking is not so much the wherewithal for providing aid as the good will 
permit me one further comment 
although it was less evident in the case of the consequences of the storm the tanker disaster off the french coast has made it very clear that we need to give the commission a helping hand on another matter 
the european union needs rules governing environmental liability as a matter of urgency 
we can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machinations 
we must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment 
then for example people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart 
when in over five years ago that is i joined the legal affairs committee in this parliament i became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier 
to this day i am still awaiting an initiative from the commission which will actually enable me to start work 
it is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste and i hope that february does not see this dossier being postponed yet again 
mr president commissioner the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise us into thinking about certain problems 
it has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters 
there have always been natural disasters and there always will be 
of course there is a need for solidarity here 
there is certainly a need for european civil protection and the eu budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters 
but most importantly it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature-mankind relationship is concerned despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries and never nature for nature cannot make mistakes 
the extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density the type of infrastructure and of course the many monocultures if we are talking forests 
of course i am in favour of providing assistance where we can 
but when it comes to aid we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone cabling underground 
we must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation rather than monocultures 
the most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate 
to this day we in europe remain in the privileged position of having the gulf stream and the gulf stream still does its stuff 
america and south-east asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and storms go 
we are fortunate in having the gulf stream 
but in common with others we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect 
this is partly the work of human hand as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations 
we must take more account of the guidelines produced at the kyoto environmental conference 
we must reduce co2 emissions employ renewable energies and generally make enquiries in this connection as to how the forests of europe are faring 
mr president i think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victims 
this is an irreparable loss 
secondly we welcome the solidarity between the french departments and citizens and the solidarity of other countries with france which is the country worst affected 
as i have little time mr president i would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution 
i believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not 
that is to say that experts are ever more convinced that climate change and human activities in general terms are linked to the increase seen in natural disasters in recent years 
in fact over the last decade the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the century 
therefore europe must be clearly committed to the kyoto protocol and make specific proposals 
furthermore we should utilise an extraordinary budget line since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation 
first of all we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy 
it is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by european standards 
it is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this 
i want to thank the commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at european level to give assistance to member states and regions that have tragedies like this 
that is important 
the other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past 
it was very small 
it was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by members of this house proposing action when the disasters were not even major 
officials and ministers from member states were coming to brussels whispering with the commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies 
so there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished 
i think we should reinstate this budget line 
when we had the earthquake in greece which was a big disaster the community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the greeks 
the same when the floods came in france and the same again now 
these are major disasters we should have an instrument we do not have it 
we should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument 
we can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it 
we did not have it so bad in ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the atlantic 
we had floods in ireland also and i want to express my sympathy with the people in ireland who suffered from these 
ladies and gentlemen none of us must forget what has taken place 
it is true that there was a joint decision by the council and parliament seeking to discontinue emergency lines 
it is also true that there is a lot of european money around 
it is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical active solidarity 
it is nothing more than the states playing at taking from peter in order to give to paul 
this is inadequate and i am personally delighted that mr barnier has stated an idea close to my heart and which moreover i expressed when i told the press in bordeaux what i am hoping for and that is the establishment of a reinforced policy of european civil security 
i therefore believe that a european civil protection force real civil relief blue helmets who would go to areas in difficulty within the union as we currently have no emergency procedure but also outside the union if needs be in venezuela or anywhere else is something that we should hope to see 
i would like to tell commissioner barnier that in me he has an active ally for this idea which strikes me as noble and truly european in spirit 
mr president commissioner when we compare the frequency with which storms occur in other parts of the world with our own situation we see that europe gets off relatively lightly 
nevertheless the storms that took place in the last week of december showed us what the consequences can be and that there are major problems in store for us 
anyone travelling to strasbourg by car or by rail would have been able to see for themselves that storms raged in alsace as well 
i would therefore like to extend my sympathy to all those citizens in the regions where the storms raged so furiously and at the same time from my position here in this chamber point to how important it is to support these regions and people 
each and every one of us knows that any other region of europe could meet with just such a fate tomorrow 
what we need to do now is to deal with the fallen timber as swiftly as possible 
for it is common knowledge that we could have an even greater disaster on our hands if the fallen timber were to be left in the forests too long 
that is why it is absolutely essential to deal with the fallen timber before the warmer weather arrives 
decades will have gone by before we are able to determine the true extent of the damage sustained by the forestry industry 
for we all know how long it takes a tree to grow 
the calculations are in decades rather than years 
in addition i would like to point out that the forestry industry is certainly not just about timber production for barrier woodland and woodland that acts as a shield against avalanches also constitute an important factor in certain regions 
i am therefore very proud to say that the skilled austrian forestry workers are also prepared 
mr president i extend our deepest sympathy to all of those who were affected by the storms 
sometimes within the community we do not actually have an awareness of what is happening in other countries 
we had very little coverage in ireland of the tanker that sank 
i was asked to highlight the result of the storms in ireland 
we had high winds and unprecedented prolonged rainfall which adding to existing difficulties resulted in thousands of acres being submerged sometimes in up to feet of water 
we experienced the human misery of flooded homes and farms no sanitation no drinking water and the environmental disasters of e.coli-infected water 
i talked with farmers whose ewes were aborting their lambs due to drinking the infected water 
natural habitats were destroyed 
so i ask that ireland be remembered in this particular case 
i thank the commissioner and support him very much in his european protection force 
mr president commissioner i second all those who expressed their solidarity with the storm victims 
i would just like to point again to the impact on the forestry industry throughout europe 
for the storms will have major implications for the forestry industry in all areas of europe and i believe we need in the long-term to give thought to how problems of this kind are to be dealt with in future 
we certainly do not want market organisation for forests but maybe we should set up a system perhaps in conjunction with the private insurance sector which will make it possible to mitigate the implications for the victims in some way 
unfortunately we can expect there to be repeat performances of this kind of major disaster in the future 
as has already been mentioned here there are indications no proof but clear indications that the increase in storms world-wide has to do with the climate catastrophe 
of course the scientists do not all see eye to eye on this yet but the majority of them are fairly convinced that if we continue to emit greenhouse gases as we are doing these storms will of course hit us much harder still at the dawn of this new century 
i believe now is the right time for us to think back once again to a proposal put forward in this chamber by a former fellow mep of ours tom spencer 
he suggested that rather than giving storms the names of men or women we should name them after the perpetrators of the greenhouse effect he proposed the oil companies at the time 
however an exception should certainly be made in the case of shell and bp for they have changed policy and do not just base their sales on fossil fuels which are damaging to the climate rather they also invest in forms of energy that have future viability 
we must be aware of this connection i do not support those who make sweeping statements to the effect that the greenhouse effect is to blame for this storm but one thing we can be relatively certain of is that we have reason to fear further catastrophes if we do not soon alter our course 
mr president i would first like to thank you for proposing to extend this debate in order to see it through 
next i would like to say that as a commissioner but also as a french citizen i have been very touched by the expressions of sympathy and solidarity that i have heard from many european members of parliament from throughout the union 
we can therefore see thanks to this debate a picture of the europe which i believe in one which is not merely a supermarket but which is also a place of humanism 
i would like to thank mrs scallon mr martin mr mccartin mrs gonzález álvarez and mr savary who have in particular taken up or supported the idea which i am putting forward for a more united more operational more easily understood response for civil security or civil protection 
this could be achieved by creating a european civil security force and we shall continue to advance this idea which we shall keep you informed of in the coming months 
but i have been a parliamentarian for a long time and i shall not tell you your job as you know how the budget and the general regulation of the structural funds work 
you voted for this budget and therefore you understand perfectly well the framework in which i operate 
i am not going to pull the wool over your eyes 
i want to discharge my responsibilities seriously 
this does not mean that i think it is in fact impossible to reintroduce an emergency aid line in any rigorous way with a very strict specification 
this line only ever consisted of a few million euros in any case 
that would not have any effect on the scale of the disasters and their consequences from which we are currently suffering 
you know this budget 
this is the framework in which i have to operate and i try as i am responsible together with mrs diamantopoulou for objective and with mr fischler for the eaggf to ensure that when we respond to these disasters immediately and in the medium term we are able to use this european money as efficiently as possible 
i am therefore not opposed to changes to these budgetary rules and perhaps at the next budget we will discuss this again particularly in order to establish at least in symbolic terms the emergency line which was discontinued two years ago 
in the meantime there is a great deal of money and mr gollnisch i cannot allow you to say that it will be used in some remote hypothetical time 
this money is available now this year 
if the national authorities do their job properly and i am sure that they will we will be able to raise appropriations for specific problems and projects from the middle of and in the next few years 
this money is plentiful even if it cannot according to objective cover all the areas affected 
in particular it could be made use of and i am saying this to mr liese to mrs mathieu and i did not mention a policy in its infancy where forestry is concerned mrs mathieu to mrs keppelhoff-wiechert and to mrs schierhuber 
in addition to objective as regards forestry a subject which i consider to be extremely important that is the restoration of our forestry heritage there are opportunities apart from zoning which the substantial appropriations from the eaggf guarantee section have made possible 
finally i would like to say or repeat that not all of these disasters necessarily have natural causes 
i say this with great humility 
some of you are extremely knowledgeable and competent in these matters even if in the past i have happened to write several works on ecological and environmental issues 
indeed i think that through political will we could limit the consequences of certain disasters 
i think that this applies in the case of both floods and storms 
mr kronberger mr messner and mrs gonzález álvarez mentioned the important issues of climate and i would like to say that there is probably somewhere a link between the consequences of these natural disasters and the policies for which europe must remain one of the driving forces for prevention in terms of the major environmental issues 
i would like to thank you mr president and parliament for giving the commission the opportunity to state its views 
we shall now work within the framework of the budget and the current rules to ensure that the available appropriations which you have made available to us are used in the most constructive and rapid way in order to deal with the consequences of these disasters 
they must also provide an economic political and human response to families that have been seriously affected by them 
that concludes the debate 
the vote will be taken at noon on thursday 
the next item is the communication on food safety and a statement by the commission 
mr president i am very pleased to take this first available opportunity of outlining to parliament the main lines of the commission's white paper on food safety adopted on wednesday last january in association with my colleague mr liikanen 
at my hearing last september i promised speedy delivery of this white paper 
i am happy that we have been able to deliver so quickly 
the white paper represents three to four months of intensive work since the new commission was appointed last september 
it takes on board the extensive consultations of the past couple of years since the commission's green paper on food law was published 
equally it reflects our experiences of recent food alerts in such areas as dioxin and sludge as well as the bse crisis 
the white paper also reflects the concerns of this parliament which you have outlined to both president prodi and myself on the numerous occasions we have debated food safety in this house since the commission was appointed 
i do not need to remind you that consumer confidence in europe's food safety regime has been badly affected by the crises and alerts of recent years and months 
the commission is fully committed to restoring that confidence by putting in place the most up-to-date and effective food safety regime in the world 
when i launched the white paper last week i said that the shopping trolley is one of the most potent weapons on the face of the earth 
the most discerning decisions are made by the consumers of europe 
if their confidence is damaged this is reflected in shopping decisions 
this in turn has a dramatic effect on farmers producers and industry generally 
in an industry worth some eur billion annually even a slight dip in confidence levels can have significant effects 
between the agro-food sector and the farming sector there are over million employees 
high levels of confidence are necessary to boost job numbers and competitiveness 
this crisis of confidence has also had the unfortunate but inevitable effect of eroding the trust of consumers in the systems and institutions at national and european level that should monitor and assure the highest standards of food safety 
in saying all of this i would like to make it clear that europe nevertheless has one of the best food industries in the world and also one of the safest food control systems 
the challenge is to make the system the very best 
the overall objective therefore of the white paper on food safety is to put in place the necessary legislation and structures that will guarantee the highest possible level of health protection for consumers arising from the consumption of food 
we are setting out a challenging and ambitious agenda for change 
the commission will need the full support of parliament if we are to achieve our ambitions on schedule 
we will also need the fullest support from the council and other key stakeholders 
the white paper on food safety outlines a comprehensive range of actions needed to complement and modernise existing eu food legislation 
all of these measures are designed to make it more coherent understandable and flexible 
we want to promote better enforcement of that legislation and to provide greater transparency to consumers 
the detailed action plan on food safety in the white paper sets a precise timetable for action over the next three years 
over measures are envisaged 
our objective is to put in place a coherent and up-to-date body of food law by the end of 
we are also envisaging the establishment of a european food authority by as an essential complement to the new food safety regime 
this idea will be the focus of much scrutiny and debate 
it has already attracted much comment including reactions from members of parliament 
the chapter of the white paper devoted to the establishment of a european food authority is clearly designed to elicit views and comments 
we are seeking views by the end of april on what we envisage 
i will return to this process of consultation in a few moments 
the commission believes that major structural change is required in our system of food safety to ensure the twin objectives of assuring the highest standard of food safety and restoring consumer confidence 
why should a european food authority be an essential part of that structure of change 
the first key concern is independence 
key stakeholders including consumers are seeking a system that is independent and perceived to be independent of all vested interests 
we must also ensure excellence and transparency 
we have made a lot of progress over the past couple of years since the reformed system of scientific advice was adopted as a consequence of the bse crisis 
however the commission believes that we must go further 
we must create a permanent and truly independent excellent and transparent system of risk assessment 
the key task of the authority will be risk assessment in the area of food safety 
we envisage that the work of the existing five scientific committees devoted to food safety will be transferred to the authority 
they may not be transferred in their present form or structure this is an issue on which we will elicit views before making our definitive proposals on the authority's establishment 
however if we were merely to propose a simple moving of deckchairs this would clearly not be enough 
as the white paper makes clear the new authority must be a value-added structure 
i am of the view that the existing system of scientific advice needs to be strengthened 
within the authority i envisage much stronger scientific and other support for the independent scientists 
i am also envisaging that the authority will be much more proactive than our current regime anticipate rather than react identify issues before they become crises 
this proactive approach should become the hallmark of the authority 
to be proactive the white paper identifies a number of new areas that would be embraced by the authority 
these include a comprehensive information gathering and surveillance function the coordination of scientific information in the eu and building up strong networks with food safety agencies and bodies in member states 
as part of its remit we also envisage the authority operating an enhanced rapid alert system for food and feed concerns 
the commission has decided that it is neither appropriate nor feasible to devolve risk management power to the authority 
we believe that decisions in the risk management area should properly remain the preserve of the commission parliament and council 
i make no apology for this approach i firmly believe that it is the correct one 
certainly there are those who would argue that we should give law-making powers to such an authority 
i do not accept those views and reject them with some degree of passion 
it was only last year that the treaty was amended to give parliament a much greater role in the legislative process 
to give such a role to an authority at this stage would be in my view a retrograde step and represent a dilution of democratic accountability 
i will be very interested to hear the views of parliament itself in relation to this matter 
there are also those who argue that the commission could effectively ignore the advice of the new authority 
i also reject this line of argument 
how could a commissioner for health and consumer protection reject or ignore well-founded independent scientific advice in relation to food safety 
would this be in the interests of europe's citizens 
in my view most definitely not unless such rejection of the scientific arguments were soundly based rationally argued and fully justified 
it seems difficult to envisage such a situation evolving 
i can assure you here today that the commission in exercising its risk management functions will fully take account of the scientific advice of the authority 
i have already said that the authority will be charged with developing networks with national food safety agencies and bodies in the member states 
this is a major task 
we must develop greater certainty in the science that underpins food safety in the european union 
the authority must become the authoritative source of scientific advice and information on food safety issues 
this situation will not come about by the very creation of the authority but will evolve over time as confidence is gained in the authority itself 
i do not believe we can be prescriptive in the area of science and advice based on science 
however with the evolution of dynamic networks with national scientific bodies and agencies the authority will become pre-eminent on the european stage 
i am also anxious to hear the views of parliament in this regard 
as an integral part of a value-added structure the white paper proposes that the authority would have a major role in risk communication to disseminate complex scientific information in a consumer-friendly way to be the obvious and indispensable port of call for the most up-to-the-minute data on risk to be highly visible to tell the good news story about food to be proactive 
the white paper also contains very important proposals in respect of controls 
this is a hugely important component of the system of checks and balances to ensure that member states and operators are complying with community legislation 
i want to see a genuine internal market operating in the control arena 
in this context we are also proposing to strengthen significantly the control function carried out by the food and veterinary office located in dublin 
this revised community framework would have three core elements operational criteria set up at community level community control guidelines and enhanced administrative cooperation in the development and operation of control 
as part of our proposals in this area which i expect to bring forward at the end of this year i will be examining whether additional powers in addition to infringement procedures need to be given to the commission 
these could include withholding community financial support or recouping funding already committed to a member state 
these proposals must be seen as part of our mission to have the highest food safety standards in the world boost consumer confidence and increase markets for farmers and producers in the union 
in addition to the proposals for a new european food authority and an enhanced control system at community-level the white paper proposes an action plan with a wide range of measures to improve and bring coherence to the community's legislation covering all aspects of food products from farm to table 
it sets out over separate actions that are envisaged over the period ahead and intends to close identified loopholes in current legislation 
the new legal framework will cover animal feed animal health and welfare hygiene contaminants and residues novel food additives flavourings packaging and irradiation 
it will include a proposal on general food law which will embody the principles of food safety such as responsibility of feed manufacturers farmers and food operators traceability of feed food and ingredients proper risk analysis through for instance risk assessment that is scientific advice and information analysis risk management that is regulation and control risk communication and application of the precautionary principle if and when appropriate 
as regards the precautionary principle i might add that the commission is currently finalising a communication which i expect to be adopted very soon 
i look forward to having a useful exchange of views this afternoon with the members of parliament who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if there had been an appropriate parliamentary forum available 
however having regard to my contacts with the presidents of the relevant committees i recognise that this was not feasible 
but i know too that we will have many further opportunities in the coming months to consider the white paper's proposals on the authority 
we now have a number of months to have the necessary debate on the commission's ideas on the white paper on the establishment of a european food authority 
parliament will have a key part to play in this debate 
parliament played a crucial role in europe's response to the bse crisis 
it has especially active since then in bringing citizens' concerns about food safety issues to the fore 
i expect that parliament's contribution to the debate on the authority can be as incisive and constructive 
while we have a number of months to the end of april to debate the issue and garner our views i recognise fully that this is also a very tight timeframe 
i would therefore ask parliament to make appropriate arrangements to ensure that its views can be formulated as quickly as possible 
it is essential that the commission should have the benefit of parliament's contribution to the shaping of what would be a key component of raising consumer health protection to a new plane and thereby restoring consumer confidence in the european union's food safety regime 
the european food authority will be a key ingredient in the eu's food safety regime in the years ahead 
it is essential that we get the mix right 
mr president i thank the commissioner for his statement 
i would like to welcome the division of labour that you have made and that food management will remain the responsibility of the european institutions including the commission and parliament 
that is very much the right approach 
but there is one word that i have not heard you mention here tonight 
i hope that we can thrash this out 
we need a body of food law as you have said and we need to agree this together 
it is very important that we include liability in that process 
that is the one word i am talking about 
the problem so far is that taxpayers paid when something went wrong 
that cannot continue 
when we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem those responsible are liable 
mr president it is a very worthwhile white paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority 
my questions relate to the positive list for animal feed 
you are unclear about this in your white paper 
what is your schedule how long will it take you to produce a positive list 
when will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof 
the final part of my question is as follows when will bse testing be binding in all member states 
that is another point i.e the question of obligation which you were somewhat unclear on in your white paper 
thank you commissioner for your statement 
i think the lines that you have set up regarding the food safety authority are a recognition of reality 
the member states would not accept a regulatory agency so there is not very much point in your proposing one 
some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs 
however as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years i have to ask if europe has the safest food control system as you have said why do we need new directives and regulations and new amending directives 
secondly will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from brussels and under-implementation in the member states 
we look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this 
regarding enlargement what plans does the commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws given that the commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the white paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 
president first of all i would like to thank mrs ahern mrs roth-behrendt and mrs jackson for their words of support in relation to the white paper 
i find that encouraging and i look forward to further discussions with them and other members of parliament in relation to the issues that they raised 
mrs ahern raised the issue of liability 
that of course is not specifically addressed in the white paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions and there are already some relating to the issue of traceability 
once that is done issues such as liability can be addressed 
i have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved 
but i have taken on board your suggestion and i will give it further consideration 
mrs roth-behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list 
that is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material 
at the moment the list is as i say a negative list and it is added to as required 
the establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it in fact 
the rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation 
rapid alert is there for food but not for feed 
this is unfortunate and it is wrong and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done 
the work in relation to bse in member states and the establishment of random testing to identify levels of infectivity in member states is ongoing i know that mrs roth-behrendt has asked me this question before and i said i thought it was coming along quickly but i understand it is in inter-service consultation in the commission and work is currently under way 
i hope that the next time you ask me the question i will be in a position to give you more detailed information 
mrs jackson has focused on the fact that there are new and amending pieces of legislation and asks whether this compounds over-regulation 
i should say that the pieces of legislation that we have identified are intended to close gaps in existing legislation 
it is not so much a matter of the establishment of new regimes or further regulation although that is part of it but of identifying where there are gaps and loopholes in the chain from farm to table and closing them 
there is a reference to applicant states and that is something that we have in mind 
standards of food safety and indeed other areas of safety are obviously of critical importance in relation to enlargement and this is a matter that i have drawn to the attention of mr verheugen 
commissioner the ignorance of certain member states has landed us in a major food crisis here in europe and i am afraid that once more i have cause to be angry at the fact that again no members of the council are in attendance and that on the day that you present your interesting report 
what i would very much like you to tell me is how you intend to guarantee that a new authority of this kind whatever name it goes by will be given influence over the council who in this authority will have the say in matters and who will issue orders 
of course we are not in a position to dictate anything in terms of content but i would insist on parliament retaining the rights accorded it under maastricht and amsterdam and even extending them 
i very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through europe anonymously like a satellite an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and i hope it does not come to that 
i also welcome the white paper 
but do you envisage that the food safety agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and france's refusal to lift the ban 
you mentioned the commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that france is acting 
would you also propose that the commission could give interim payments for instance similar to the one that the british farmers are asking for at the moment 
for example the work of the eu unit located in dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters 
it has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather publish and coordinate data make recommendations for improved food safety and as you said collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers 
all this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the european union 
i would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location 
in relation to the makeup of the authority first of all it will employ in-house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time 
in addition to that the food safety authority will have a board 
you will notice in the white paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board 
this is an issue which i expect will be discussed between parliament and the commission over the next few weeks and months 
i envisage that the board's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders 
its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal i will bring to the commission in september 
we have not done that yet but it will be done in september 
i do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work 
that would erode the independence of the scientific advice 
but it would have an overall remit particularly for instance in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research 
mr florenz asks whether parliament will have a say in that 
that is an issue for consideration and discussion 
there may be a number of views on that 
some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for parliament or members of parliament or indeed parliament nominees to be members of the board 
others may take the view that it would be a valuable exercise if parliament through nominees or even meps themselves were able to have an opportunity to discuss what issues should be investigated 
it is an issue for consideration but it has not been ruled out 
mr florenz also raised the question of anonymity 
i am happy that he raised it because it is particularly important for this authority to have a high profile 
it must be visible 
it must be known 
consumers in the european union must know of the existence of the food authority 
the ceo of the authority would be somebody who typically would be known who might appear regularly on television talking about issues relating to food particularly in relation to the good news stories surrounding food in relation to nutrition diet and such issues so that if another food crisis comes along consumers will be aware of the existence of the authority 
they will be aware that they have heard from the authority before under other circumstances and hopefully will have some bedrock of confidence already built up in the pronouncements from the authority 
it is fundamentally essential therefore that the authority is not anonymous 
it must be visible 
i will do everything i can to promote that high profile role for the authority 
mrs lynne asks whether the authority will have sufficient teeth 
i suspect that the question is focused on the issue of where the competence of the authority begins and ends and where the competence and authority of food safety agencies in member states begin and end 
there would have to be an interaction at scientific level 
quite clearly it is undesirable to have situations develop whereby scientists working for or advising the food safety authority at community level may be in disagreement with some scientific opinion at member state level 
that is an undesirable situation we do not want that situation in the future 
there are a number of things that undermine consumer confidence lack of information is one 
but information which includes a fundamental disagreement between scientists on core issues relating to food safety is also an issue of serious concern 
we must attempt to avoid that and establish the structures so as to ensure that there is a proper dissemination of information between scientists that there is full consultation and discussion and that the authority at community level has the opportunity and is mandated to seek the advice and opinion of independent scientists in all member states and indeed maybe even beyond where experts are to be found elsewhere 
over time as i said a moment ago not only will the profile of the authority be raised but its expertise its moral authority will be increased and enhanced over a period of time so that its views are accepted and not challenged 
this situation can be achieved over a period of time 
you cannot legislate for consumer confidence 
it is something that is earned over a period of time 
however the commission will have the possibility of seeing that the opinions of the authority on scientific matters are enforced by way of passing legislation which is the function of the commission parliament and council 
i realise that this is a somewhat time-consuming exercise but nonetheless the establishment of legislation arising out of the opinions of the authority is i believe the way forward 
any failure to comply with legislation is a matter that can be dealt with in the courts in the normal way 
one of the issues that we may have to address over time is the question of the speed of response in such circumstance 
i hope to see if something can be put in place to get us a faster response from the court process 
in relation to grants and subsidies yes consideration has been given to that issue 
it will require the advice of legal services and that will be sought particularly bearing in mind that it may provide a speedy response to a failure to comply with community law pending a court ruling 
in relation to mrs lynne's question on interim payments that is a matter that might very well be addressed by parliament as it relates to budget issues 
mrs myller then asked me about the location of the authority 
no decision has been taken in relation to that other than to say that it is more likely that the authority will be located centrally rather than on the periphery 
i recognise that the feo is located in dublin and although i come from that part of the world myself i have to accept that it is not the centre of europe 
but the fvo is in quite a different situation from the food safety authority 
the fvo is made up of independent scientists and vets and so on who travel from some location where there is an airport quite clearly we have an airport in dublin 
the food safety authority's situation is quite different 
it has to be close to the commission because of the need for interaction between the scientists involved in the food safety authority and those of us who are involved in the initiation of legislation 
an important part of the communication between the two institutions will obviously be to ensure that those of us who are involved in the drafting of legislation understand clearly and perfectly what it is the scientists mean what problems they have identified what legislation is necessary to deal with the issues they raise 
equally the scientists will wish to have some input into the legal process or the policy-making process or the law-drafting process to ensure that the legislation meets the ills that they have identified 
it seems to me desirable for an authority of this type to be centrally located 
scientists will be employed in-house but it will also be necessary to liaise with scientists on a consultative basis and in those circumstances as scientists will have to travel it is probably better that they move to a central location once again where the parliamentary structures and the commission and council are based 
that is my judgement at the moment 
it may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and i will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery 
colleagues i am in a very difficult position because i cannot change the agenda 
i would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the conference of presidents 
if you feel that these sessions after a commission statement are important i would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that is allocated to them 
on this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the house and we have had minutes of response by the commissioner and his statement 
as you can see half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session 
i hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the commission on such future occasions 
that concludes the debate 
we will examine questions to the commission 
we will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to question time 
we will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session 
mr purvis has the floor for a procedural motion 
i object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for question time it is one of the few occasions when backbenchers have a chance to get their time on the floor and i do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda 
that is the agenda and i think that we should stick to the agenda 
the fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at p.m. and you can see the clock 
i hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event 
subject construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone turkey the two recent earthquakes in turkey registering more than on the richter scale raise tremendous doubts about turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at akkuyu while energy reserves produced by the atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the eu spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes 
turkey's nuclear plans which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of turkey and the surrounding region prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of canadian origin of the type acquired by india and pakistan 
what steps will the commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the eu but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the eu budget 
mr verheugen has the floor on behalf of the commission 
the commission is following with interest the planned construction of a nuclear power plant in akkuyu turkey and recognises the importance of ensuring that the construction of the new plant follows the highest internationally accepted nuclear safety standards 
according to our information the decision on the selection of a bidder has not been taken yet 
the commission acknowledges the fact that turkey has signed and ratified the convention on nuclear safety and recognises that the responsibility for granting licences and regulating the siting construction commissioning operation and decommissioning of nuclear power plants in turkey rests entirely with the turkish atomic energy authority 
the commission does not have a mandate to impose any limits on decisions taken by any country in terms of energy production including the nuclear option 
as commissioner wallström indicated during the hearings in the european parliament in september the commission will bring up the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection in any relevant meeting with the turkish government in the future and i am happy to inform you that i will have a meeting with the turkish foreign minister in a couple of days and will certainly raise the issue 
in particular the commission is aware of the public concerns about the recorded seismic activity in the area of the ecemis fault line located in the vicinity of the proposed plant site 
according to information received from the international atomic agency the design of the plant takes into account the possibility of earthquakes stronger than any ever recorded in the area and particularly more than ten times stronger than the one registered in june in adana 
large design margins are being provided in order to ensure safe operation of the plant according to the environmental conditions of the site 
the commission is also aware of concern about the possible intention of using the plant to produce weapons-grade material 
it acknowledges the fact that turkey has signed and ratified the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and has subsequently concluded a comprehensive safeguards agreement with the international atomic energy agency 
thank you for your reply 
i should like to make the following points turkey is now a candidate country 
this plan is designed to increase its energy potential by % 
at the same time it also wishes to acquire cadou type reactors from canada which we now know have already been used for nuclear weapons in pakistan and india 
in this sense there is therefore a serious risk that some idiot will decide that the new geopolitical balance of power in the caucasus calls for a nearby country with weapons grade nuclear technology 
so much for the political aspect 
now to the technical aspect 
the safety factor in this type of project and i am speaking as an engineer has nothing to do with increasing safety levels in relation to the risk of collapse by a factor of ten or twenty 
in cases such as this where there is uncertainty simulators are used 
however we cannot used simulators in cases relating to nuclear energy 
in this sense all high seismic risk areas must be excluded a priori for nuclear installations such as this 
therefore and given that the relationship between the european union and the commission and turkey has now changed it would be a good idea if turkey discussed certain matters relating both to the safety of the area in general and the peaceful development of turkey within the european union 
a couple of weeks ago we had a debate in parliament on the nuclear safety issue with special regard to the candidate countries 
i have explained the position of the commission 
you have to accept the fact that there is no acquis communautaire on nuclear safety 
so what we did was use political means to convince some candidate countries that we have to have decommissioning plans for some reactors that are considered not to be upgradable 
in the case of turkey it is different 
the plant is not yet there 
i have already said that turkey is part of the npt and of the convention on nuclear safety 
if we see in the development of that nuclear power plant that there are concerns about safety we will discuss it with turkey 
if the conclusion is that turkey is planning to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet normal european safety standards is concerned then we would do the same as we did with lithuania slovakia and bulgaria 
mr president the commissioner said that turkey has signed the non-proliferation treaty it has signed the nuclear safety treaties why should there be any doubt at all but that turkey's nuclear plant should not be just as safe as any in the community and would the commissioner be prepared to take a rather more robust position with mr souladakis on this matter 
i think it is the right of a member of parliament to raise his own concerns and fears 
i do not have these concerns 
i believe that turkey completely recognises the standards and the criteria of the convention on nuclear safety and the non-proliferation treaty but there is no doubt that there are concerns in the public in europe and i think it is quite right to discuss them here in parliament 
subject depleted uranium weapons has the commission conducted any studies of the potential effects upon eu states of transboundary pollution arising from the use of depleted uranium weapons in the kosovan conflict 
if not why not 
mrs wallström has the floor on behalf of the commission 
thank you mr bowe for your question 
the european commission has monitored the environmental effects of the conflict from the beginning of the nato action 
as early as last june the commission financed a first study 
it was carried out by the regional environment centre for central and eastern europe and concluded that there had been no large-scale ecological catastrophe 
none of the subsequent evidence or analysis has overturned that original assessment 
the commission has also been closely associated with the production of the recent report published by the united nations environment programme balkan task force 
this is the most detailed and comprehensive report to date on the environmental effects of the kosovo conflict and i recommend it to those who have not yet studied it 
the use of depleted uranium weapons was one of the many issues considered and this report is now widely available also on the net 
the balkan task force was hampered by the fact that little or no information was available on the actual use of these weapons during the conflict 
no indications of contamination were found in kosovo during the btf fact-finding mission 
however this does not exclude the possibility that areas in kosovo are contaminated by depleted uranium 
from a desk assessment coupled with a fact-finding mission the report concludes that the risks if any are limited to an area around the target 
future actions will take place within the stability pact for south-eastern europe 
a special regional environmental reconstruction plan is also being developed 
it will form the framework for emergency assistance for combating war damage if such action should be needed 
first of all mr president can i thank the commissioner for that very useful response 
clearly the commission has given some consideration to this problem and i am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue 
but i would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used 
this uranium becomes air-borne is inhaled and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far 
this seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the gulf war 
i would therefore ask the commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a localised way within kosovo 
how long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons 
thank you mr bowe for that question 
we have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean-up of kosovo 
but those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium 
that is also mentioned in the report 
no transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the federal republic of yugoslavia 
the problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted 
a big responsibility rests with the united nations because they are addressed with this report so they have to take responsibility 
but through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is for the time being the kind of frame we can use for the work of the european union 
it is important to follow up and it gives the member states as well as the united nations and the commission something to think about when it is a matter concerning military secrets and their effects on the environment 
it also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons 
mr president commissioner in a few months' time hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for the adriatic coast to spend their summer holiday 
we know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast 
are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the adriatic this summer and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect 
i wish i could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately i am not able to 
we make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this 
that is what we rely on when we advise people on what to do 
what we have seen is that war affects the environment in the long term and is dangerous 
in the environmental field we have just passed a directive on marine pollution 
that also includes bullets and weapons and so on and it is an early warning system 
unfortunately we are not able to give guarantees and we can only continue to monitor and try to do the clean-up exercise 
i wanted to ask the commissioner whether it is true that soldiers of the nato armed forces now stationed in that region undergo special controls against nuclear radiation and that the same measures are not applied to civilians living in the area 
i cannot answer that question 
when it comes to medical checks and so on i do not have all the information needed to give a proper answer 
what we know from the environmental side is what i have already mentioned that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan but when it comes to medical check-ups i do not have the information about that 
of course i can go back and see whether we can find the necessary information 
subject appointment of a european union envoy for tibet in the tibetan government in exile received over tibetans who escaped over the himalayan mountains seeking freedom and refuge at risk of life and limb 
many of the refugees had been severely frost-bitten and many had died along the way 
the tibet intergroup is very concerned about the worsening situation in tibet and it is clear that the current policy of the european union has proved inadequate to address the grave human rights abuses faced by tibetans daily in tibet 
the tibet intergroup therefore gravely concerned about the continuing human rights abuses in tibet and supporting the dalai lama s proposal for dialogue with the chinese government to resolve the situation in tibet calls on the commission to appoint a special envoy for tibet to address the concerns of the european union and to help bring the tibetan and chinese authorities together for dialogue 
when will the commission appoint a special envoy for tibet 
mr patten has the floor on behalf of the commission 
the concerns expressed by the european parliament about tibet are widely shared 
i have long believed in the need to set out our views on human rights issues including tibet firmly and candidly to the chinese authorities 
the european union did that at the european union­china summit in peking last month where we pressed the chinese on a number of human rights issues including tibet 
we again urged the chinese to begin a dialogue with the dalai lama 
i urge the chinese again to do so 
we will continue to raise tibet with the chinese authorities 
we are also doing a number of other things in the european union-china human rights dialogue we have focused on a number of practical steps including sending experts on assignment to tibet planning development assistance programmes and activities focusing on health education and training for tibetans 
the appointment of an eu special envoy for tibet would be primarily a matter for the council to decide and parliament might care to take the issue up directly with them 
but for my part i am not sure that it would add much practical value to our efforts 
it would be unlikely to have much impact on the chinese authorities and we already have effective channels of communication with the tibetan community in exile 
i am also keen to guard against an exponential growth in the number of special envoys however worthy the cause 
mr president mr patten of course you are very well-qualified to comment on account of the time you spent in china and you are well aware of how hard the tibetans are trying to initiate a debate something which has always been blocked hitherto 
however if your response was to be that we should turn to mr cfsp that is to mr solana then i fear that this would constitute a one-sided approach to an external policy matter 
your approach which i am very much in favour of since it is a coherent one takes its inspiration from the issue of human rights i wholeheartedly agree that we must embrace the cause of human rights 
imprisonment torture the mutilation of young women and so on and so forth are definitely issues that we could discuss ad infinitum 
if we cut down here and say that the council now shares responsibility for this then i fear that these human rights issues will not be given the attention they deserve 
the possibility of stressing the importance of business and trade in the first place but also making very sure that we include human rights in the equation would be a step we should take in tandem with the european commission rather than saying that it is a matter for the council 
let me make clear to the honourable member what the position is 
i stated nothing but the truth when i said that the appointment of special envoys was a matter for the council 
as it happens we deal with the budgetary consequences the council makes the appointment 
some may think that the budgetary point should be looked at in due course 
putting that on one side because that is the situation it does not mean that we do not have a view and a competence in human rights issues 
i am very much hoping in the next few months that the commission will be able to produce a communication on human rights pointing out among other things that there is no disjunction whatsoever between a regard for human rights in china or other places in the world and the trading and commercial interests and other interests of the european union 
i have long believed that we should all recognise that countries where it is best to do business are countries that treat their own citizens most decently everywhere in the world 
i repeat that we have made our position known to the chinese on tibet 
during the few months that i have been a commissioner that has happened twice first of all in new york at our meeting with minister tang and most recently at the meeting in peking and we will continue to make that concern manifest 
if i can make a literary commendation to the honourable member who i recognise is interested in these subjects i recommend to him a book published just before christmas written by isabel hilton the distinguished journalist on the problems of tibet 
mr president i would like to start my additional question with the tibetan greeting which betokens peace and happiness 
we are not just talking about human rights and the environment where tibet is concerned rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace serenity compassion as the dalai lama would say to us europeans 
the question before us now is what can the commission do to provide more practical support for his holiness the dalai lama' s proposal for a peaceful solution to the tibet affair 
i would point out that doing nothing will be the death of tibetan culture and will mean the end of the tibetan people 
i have much sympathy with what the honourable member has said about cultural heritage and about the buddhist tradition 
like the honourable member i have read the autobiography of the dalai lama 
it is an extremely moving account not just of his responsibilities in and towards tibet but also of his spiritual views as well 
the commission like others has urged dialogue 
the dalai lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes 
i wish that the chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the dalai lama 
at or around the time of president clinton's visit to china the president of the people's republic of china gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda 
it would be very beneficial not just for tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in asia but it would also be greatly to the credit of the government of the people's republic of china if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue 
subject commission's rejection of legislation on proper administration in the eu according to newspaper reports the commission has rejected the proposal by eu ombudsman jacob söderman for a citizens right to proper administration in the eu 
although the commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service 
are these reports accurate 
what is the reason for the commission s acting in this way and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of eu administration 
does the commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five-point programme agreed between parliament and the commission in september and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows parliament to express an opinion on it 
mr patten has the floor on behalf of the commission 
the newspaper reports that the honourable member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate 
in november the commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its rules of procedure 
at the moment the commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks 
the commission will then adopt the code at second reading 
it should be noted that the new commission gave an immediate follow-up to the european ombudsman decision of july in his own-initiative inquiry related to the code 
the commission would like to stress in particular that in the drafting of the code it has taken on board all the draft recommendations of the european ombudsman 
the code will be a document exclusively dealing with the relations of the commission's administration with the public 
it will be adopted through a legally-binding commission decision to be published in the official journal of the european communities 
the document has been drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the draft prepared by the european ombudsman's office 
according to the related provisions in the treaties the responsible legislator for establishing its rules of procedure is the commission itself 
however it goes without saying that the commission adheres to the principle of regular political dialogue with the european parliament on all aspects of administrative reform 
mr president i would like to thank the commissioner 
however i would still like to ask when this code will finally come into force bearing in mind that it has been on the agenda since 
the newspaper reports were misleading 
i do not think there is any difference between us and the ombudsman 
there is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and i think we are soundly placed on that 
i want to repeat that honourable members like the honourable member who asked the question who take a particular interest in this issue will want to have a dialogue about it 
it is extremely important and i recognise the concern of the honourable member 
i want to thank the commission for what i perceive as a very positive answer 
is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved 
let me read what it says in my brief and as it is in my brief it must be true 
i would like to stress again that the commission has accepted all the ombudsman's recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of july 
both documents that is the commission's document and the ombudsman's draft cover largely the same ground 
the only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis 
i can go into that in detail if the honourable member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the ombudsman on this important issue 
as the author is not present question no lapses 
i apologise to mr vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy 
i am sorry 
according to the rules of procedure you are not required to reply 
i wish you a good evening 
questions and of questions to the commission were intended for mr nielson 
mr nielson cannot be present today since he is in south africa 
i must tell you that the vice-president of the commission mrs loyola de palacio has sent me a kind letter giving me all sorts of explanations and informing me that mr patten will reply to the questions 
'mainstreaming' means taking account of equality between women and men as an integral part of all forms of development policy strategy and measures 
to achieve that the council's guidelines must be implemented in their entirety 
current staff must receive compulsory training in equal opportunities and days' training in such issues should form an essential part of the directorate-general for development's introductory courses for new staff 
is the commission prepared to take such measures 
can i first of all emphasise how sorry my colleague mr nielson was that he could not be here but the honourable members who are concerned about these development questions will know how important his mission is trying to ensure that our agreement with south africa survives 
the commission is prepared to look at the possibility of making an introduction to gender and development part of the so-called induction courses for new staff something that has been done already but not i admit on a regular basis 
the training of staff moving to the delegations in the different regions is another entry point 
the training then would be automatically performed without being compulsory 
we also aim to include training in these issues in the basic training that our officials receive in project cycle management 
as far as possible we want to see this sort of training automatically built into programmes at the outset instead of having to be tackled separately and later 
my own view as a former development minister is that these issues should be mainstreamed themselves and tackled at the heart of training and not turned into a sort of optional add-on 
the quest for equality should permeate the work of the directorate-general for development at all levels 
it is not to be brought in as a sort of optional add-on 
in addition measures must be taken to combat differences on the grounds of gender 
equality must permeate not only projects and programmes but also all overarching goals action plans and strategies 
it would appear that we are in agreement about this 
however responsibility for ensuring that due attention is given to equality lies with departmental and unit managers 
if the latter do not have the required professional competence then nothing will happen and gender mainstreaming will no longer be a priority 
extremely few members of the directorate-general for development that is to say unit managers and more senior managers have taken part in the gender courses that have been organised 
only one manager has participated in gender training and for half a day 
that is naturally unacceptable 
what is the commission prepared to do to ensure that unit managers and more senior managers go through the necessary gender training 
gender has in fact been included in the compulsory introductory course for new employees but then with only one to two hours devoted to it on each course 
this limited training element has however been removed from all introductory courses which have taken place in recent times 
as i point out in my question one to two days and not one to two hours need to be devoted to the subject 
my question is this is the commission really prepared to comply with the adopted guidelines for gender mainstreaming at the directorate-general for development 
well i certainly take gender mainstreaming seriously and so does my colleague commissioner nielson 
i must not go on about books but i have just been reading the book by david landis barnhill on what makes some countries prosperous and some countries less prosperous and it is interesting to see there the importance that he attaches to gender issues in the economic prosperity and political stability of societies going back millennia 
secondly in my view while the training that we are talking about should not be compulsory after all there is no compulsory training on anything in the commission it should be essential 
and since it should be essential i would hope that everybody would make certain that they had adequate gender training 
that goes for everybody at whatever level of seniority 
it is not something which more senior officials can deem appropriate for their juniors but think that they are too grown-up or too senior to receive themselves 
thirdly one of the best approaches to this issue is to integrate gender as an important and cross-cutting issue into the most popular courses for development officials and above all perhaps for the project cycle management course which is key to good management of projects on the ground 
so i sympathise very much with what the honourable member has said 
i hope the approach that we are following both demonstrates practicality and the imperative of giving this the attention which it deserves 
subject aid for central asia what development aid and what humanitarian aid does the commission grant to the countries of central asia and what is its assessment of the impact of this aid 
since the community has provided significant financial support to the new independent states including the countries of central asia 
the major part of european union aid has been provided under the tacis programme 
in and kyrgyzstan kazakhstan uzbekistan and turkmenistan received technical assistance of eur million 
this assistance has delivered benefits in all sectors in particular agriculture infrastructure development the private economy and the strengthening of institutions 
security considerations have prevented tajikistan from benefiting fully from tacis but a rehabilitation programme of eur million has been in place in and 
in addition to national programmes the european union has supported important regional actions in the energy transport and environmental sectors 
food security programmes in central asia began in following two previous years when the european union provided food aid in kind 
these programmes have benefited kyrgyzstan and to a more limited extent tajikistan 
funding for ngo programmes in tajikistan amounted to eur million in and 
over the same period kyrgyzstan received eur million 
since the commission's european community humanitarian office echo has been active in supporting the most vulnerable groups and sectors in tajikistan and kyrgyzstan 
in and eur million was granted to kyrgyzstan and tajikistan received over eur million mainly for food medical supplies water and sanitation 
frequent monitoring and situation assessments have shown that european union assistance is contributing to the stability of these countries and therefore the ongoing peace process 
mr president commissioner there is a risk of central asia and the caspian sea becoming the balkans of the century 
that is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of turkmenistan and uzbekistan in particular 
that is why i would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within your own sphere of competence how the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are going that is with regard to political relations that is 
we were able at the istanbul summit a couple of weeks ago to meet and have discussions with some of the central asian republics 
i am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them 
i can send the honourable member if he would like a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the central asian republics 
obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future is on the gloomy side 
but i have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of central asia 
i have heard the honourable member talk in the past about the caucasus as well 
he is absolutely right to say that a union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much devastation in the balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise had we taken more pre-emptive measures if those had been possible 
so the honourable member's remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made 
we are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact 
our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty alleviation 
those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more soundly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of raping the land 
there is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to 
this is not the usual state of affairs 
and furthermore the commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time 
thank you very much mr patten for your interventions today 
subject greek action plan for employment according to the findings of the evaluation of action plans for employment greece and italy are the main targets for criticism from the commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies 
the report states that in greece and italy targets for improving employability have not yet been reached and it is doubtful whether the policies to be implemented will enable the guidelines on preventing and dealing with long-term unemployment to be complied with 
the report also comments that in greece there are no plans for medium to long-term measures aimed at reducing employment tax and insurance charges or for the satisfactory use of european social fund resources to support employment policies and in addition that there are no exact employment figures 
could the commission say whether the greek government has made any specific commitments on how to tackle the problems of youth and long-term unemployment and what these commitments are 
has the government legislated for and put into place a suitable system for pinpointing recording and monitoring fluctuations in unemployment or are most of the measures perhaps still limited to counting those out of work 
as far as mr papayannakis' question is concerned in the action plan for employment the commission proposed certain recommendations for greece with a view to improving the efficiency of the action plan for employment 
the most important recommendations related to the need to improve efforts to reform public sector services where problems exist improve the statistical monitoring system and apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines and of the action plan for employment 
the greek government introduced two specific programmes in as part of its employment policy yes to work and back to work 
we do not yet have the final results of these programmes and cannot yet tell if the quantitative objectives were achieved 
the greek government acknowledges the problem of its being unable to record human resources entering and leaving work and is therefore committed firstly to restructuring public sector employment services in greece secondly to setting up efficient employment promotion centres this programme has already started but has not yet been completed and thirdly to introducing a system of electronic employment cards and using suitable it systems to monitor all these policies 
the commission will keep a close watch on the greek government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made 
thank you commissioner for your reply 
however our current situation is as follows at % we have the second highest unemployment in europe which was not previously the case we have the biggest increase in unemployment we spend less than anyone else on the unemployed i.e less than % of gdp while other countries such as france belgium and germany spend % and it is not clear how the money received from the social fund has been used inter alia to combat unemployment 
you tell me that you as the commission have made recommendations 
i understand and welcome that and i hope that the recommendations will be adhered to 
however my question for a very long time has been this what happened with previous policies 
did anyone find work 
how many people found work 
if you cannot tell us for this year then last year and the year before 
what has been done about training 
is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors or trainees 
do we have any figures 
in other words do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in greece 
mr papayannakis the only answer i can give you is that the greek government does indeed need to step up efforts to introduce computerised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented have the quantitative results which you mentioned and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for formulating policies 
greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and as far as i can see an increase in productivity 
the action which the commission can take relates to the specific guidelines 
as you know there are guidelines on which each country is evaluated 
they concern access to training the ratio of men to women with access to training and special action for the long-term unemployed 
the commission will endeavour for all these specific guidelines to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new community framework for to 
subject danish early retirement pension scheme will the commission state whether the danish early retirement pension scheme has been approved in its entirety and whether there are disagreements between denmark and the commission in other areas of social policy 
the danish pension scheme the efterløn only allows people resident in denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in denmark to retire 
some workers have complained to the european commission because they do not have the right to retire 
the danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under danish law 
it should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not at present refer to the question of early retirement and the commission has proposed certain amendments to the regulation which are however still pending before the council 
there is as yet no european court case law on efterløn but it could validly be argued that the residence requirement is incompatible with general clauses now in force banning discrimination on the grounds of nationality 
the commission services set up a procedure for joint meetings and discussions with the danish government with a view to finding a common language and a common approach 
the last meeting on the subject was held in november and we are waiting for the commission services' final proposals on whether or not infringement proceedings will be instituted against denmark 
i noticed that the commissioner did not give a direct answer to the question of whether the danish early retirement pension scheme as a whole has been approved by the commission but it was indirectly apparent that the answer was that it has not been 
i should like to ask the commissioner expressly to confirm that the scheme has not been approved by the commission 
the commissioner also more than hinted of course that a lot of consideration was being given to bringing the whole issue of the danish early retirement pension scheme before the court of justice in luxembourg specifically on the grounds that the scheme actually discriminates against non-danish wage earners who are unable to fulfil the conditions due to the fact that they have not been in paid work for the period required under the danish system 
i should like to ask the commissioner if she can provide any approximate deadlines in connection with this matter for it is a problem which needs clarification in the context of the danish socio-political debate 
so i should be grateful if the commissioner could enlarge upon this question 
honourable member i should just like to stress that both denmark and numerous other member states are having problems interpreting the directives and transposing them into national law 
this is one such case and discussions are under way between the danish government and the commission in order to find the best possible solution to the matter to the benefit of the workers who meet the requirements and who as things stand have a right to this pension 
briefly just to follow on from that last point i invite the commission to make it absolutely clear that the commission's objections such as they are would not in any way infringe the rights of danish nationals to benefit from this scheme but simply that the commission has a concern which it has the right to have under community law to ensure that the scheme applies to all eu citizens who qualify 
i think that the answer is brief and clear 
of course it is as you say 
there will be no problem with danish nationals within denmark that is not where the problem lies 
the problem is with danish nationals or other nationals residing outside denmark 
a proposal has been drafted for a directive to amend the directive on the working time of non-consultant hospital doctors 
the content of the proposal concerns the average 48-hour working week of doctors with the possibility following negotiation of increasing it to hours 
the council commission and parliament are all agreed on the content but there is disagreement on the transitional period for implementing the directive 
parliament has proposed years the commission and the council 
this proposal is still being discussed by the council and parliament on the basis of the codecision procedure 
although there is this disagreement i should stress that all three institutions agree on the content and that every effort is being made to find a common approach to this particularly important and sensitive question which concerns an exceptionally large number of working doctors throughout europe 
which commissioners are members of this group 
how many meetings of the group have been held to date 
what concrete measures have been discussed 
this question covers several individual matters 
it refers to the special commission working group dealing with questions of equality 
the commissioners taking part are president prodi vice-president kinnock mr reding and myself 
the meetings of the working group are open and the first meeting was held on january 
three serious issues were discussed the first was the first discussion on the fifth programme for women of which i gave an initial evaluation the second issue was the report by mr busquin on the investigation into the participation of women in research and science and the third involved mr kinnock who reported to the working group on efforts being made to take account of the gender equality dimension in the overall reforms currently taking place in the community 
thank you very much commissioner for your reply although i regret the fact that this working group has taken so long to meet since this matter is of the greatest importance 
we trusted this commission from the outset to begin work on all issues relating to greater equality for men and women 
i hope that in the future things will change and meetings will become frequent because there are many issues which require the attention of the commission in order to speed up and conclude as quickly as possible those measures which will promote greater equality between men and women 
mrs avilés-perea that was an exhortation rather than a question 
but if the commissioner wishes to offer doctrine or good intentions 
allow me to say just one word 
i agree that the working group should have met earlier but at least once it did important decisions were taken straight away 
subject community equal initiative on october the commission adopted the community's equal initiative the aim of which is transnational cooperation to find and develop new means of combating discrimination and inequalities in the labour market with the focus on asylum-seekers 
under this umbrella each member state is to submit proposals in the form of a community initiative programme for that particular country 
what criteria will the commission use to approve or reject the member states' programmes 
which community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly 
the european social fund contribution for the period will total billion euro 
as the equal initiative is a joint funding venture with the member states what will greece's contribution amount to 
the equal initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people 
its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace 
the decision on this initiative was taken in berlin where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action 
this is an important aspect of this initiative 
the community initiative programme in each member state must comply with the regulation 
this is the same as the social fund regulation i.e equal comes under the social fund regulation 
i should like to stress that the equal initiative satisfies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed european strategy 
the member states i.e the national governments have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies submitting proposals selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control 
within the european commission the directorate-general for employment is responsible for implementation while financial control is the responsibility of the directorate-general for financial control the anti-fraud office and the european court of auditors 
the last question concerns the amount granted 
greece has been granted ecu million 
the contribution commitment is % rising to an % contribution from the initiative for the island regions especially the remote greek islands and a contribution by greece of % 
mr president i feel that the guidelines for the community equal initiative especially the four actions described in it will result both in complicated bureaucracy and paradoxically a non-transparent structure 
for example one wonders how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity as required by action in paragraph of the guidelines 
at the same time the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation the complicated demands of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structures as these are the only structures which can meet such demands 
however this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas 
however at the same time participation by those actually discriminated against such as asylum seekers immigrants and so on is rendered impossible or merely symbolic 
finally if you consider the overall amount which is on the small side eur billion for member states and how ambitious the objectives are i am afraid that all we shall succeed in doing is to prove that unemployment is a bad thing 
first let me say that it would be a great help to us now that we have reached the stage where this is being processed by parliament if you could make specific proposals which we could take into account 
secondly i have to say that the aim of the equal initiative is not to reduce unemployment it cannot possibly deal with the issue of reducing unemployment or to support an increase in employment 
that is the job of the european strategy for employment and the social fund which have huge sums of money and exceptionally large resources at their disposal especially for countries like greece 
the equal initiative has a specific mission 
to encourage to assist promotion to create statistics to create studies and agencies to support those sections of the population which suffer discrimination 
so what we are looking for is cooperation between local groups between local authorities and between countries in order to exchange experiences that is mainly what we are looking for and for experience to be transferred from one country to another so that it can be emulated 
this is the philosophy behind the initiative the budget is commensurate with it and our aim is for development agencies non-governmental organisations and local authorities to be involved as much as possible so that it can get as close to the people as possible 
a month ago the commission submitted a proposal on equal treatment in employment as prescribed in the treaty in order to implement article 
the ban on discrimination is the rule in the package of directives and programmes which we submitted 
these exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification 
allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this 
in a religious school it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs 
that is the sort of exemption we are talking about 
clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow member states to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification 
this is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination 
for instance religious schools could quite properly say to a roman catholic for example we do not want to employ you because you are a gay man or because you are a lesbian 
here we have from the commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression 
surely what we should be doing and i hope you will agree commissioner is engaging the person to do the job on the basis of their capability and we should not enshrine such bigotry and prejudice no matter how sincerely held 
i must stress that this exemption is not a refusal of work for any reason be it the reason which you mentioned sexual orientation ethnic discrimination or any other reason 
it allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question 
in other words it is positive discrimination 
in the example which you mentioned it is only logical that the teacher in a catholic school should be catholic 
that is the only form of exemption which is acceptable 
subject promoting jobs for women in severely less-favoured regions given the enormous difficulties in obtaining work which women face in certain severely less-favoured regions and given that these women very seldom have any resources to draw on in terms of either finance entrepreneurial or cooperative traditions or even training facilities living as they do in rural districts where % of the population is on the poverty line what measures or actions are planned to help these women overcome the hurdle of their social environment 
does the commission intend to put forward lowest common denominator policies which will properly reflect the admittedly extreme but nonetheless real-life situation of these women or will their plight once again be overlooked by the new employment policies 
obviously the cohesion policy exists for less-favoured regions and cooperation and joint action by the structural funds the social fund and the agricultural fund exist for the cohesion policy 
i should point out that the funds available for regions with problems account for one third of the total budget 
the aim of these regional policies which of course are implemented under the jointly agreed european guidelines in each member state i.e each member state is responsible for implementing this programme is to increase opportunities for work for both men and women 
i should point out that % of funding for the period i.e eur billion will go to the less-favoured regions of europe 
with particular reference now to the question of access by women to the opportunities which are created i would like to say first that there is via the social fund an entire equal opportunities pillar which the member states must implement i.e special policies for women which must use social fund resources 
secondly the leader initiative currently being studied gives special priority to development strategies which aim to give special support to women in small enterprises in the agricultural sector and in rural tourism with a view to increasing the involvement of women in agricultural regions 
commissioner thank you for giving me a well-intentioned answer which has been rigorous and well-argued 
however i can assure you that we do not with the existing measures which you have referred to reach these severely less-favoured regions 
they are areas where there is much need and we have to put them on an equal footing with those areas where we work in cooperation where almost none exists 
therefore my question is whether you could examine the possibility that some of the policies on microcredits which have brought results in cooperation could be applied to those women in severely less-favoured regions who have the odds stacked against them 
i am very familiar with the programmes which you refer to 
i can assure you that we are not reaching the areas where there is most need 
with these forecasts of the structural policy which i know very well and the forecasts of leader and rural development we will not promote as we should employment amongst women in the severely less-favoured regions 
i would therefore ask you to study the possibility of applying microcredit policies 
can the commission say what its precise intentions are regarding the presentation of a new social action programme 
in order to complete the programme and be able to present it we first need to complete our consultations with parliament the social partners and non-governmental organisations 
these discussions have already started but we will need to take account of the results in lisbon 
the lisbon european council is trying to take a new approach to the question of social exclusion and the link between social exclusion and the information society economic policy and reforms 
i have already told the european parliament that a joint meeting will be held in april between parliament and the commission after the lisbon conference so that all aspects can be discussed and the social programme for can finally be drafted 
clearly any future social action programme should take account of developments for example within information technology and in time become a modern social action programme 
but can you also provide confirmation concerning the matter i raise in my question namely that the programme will be designed in such a way that we shall obtain a concrete timetable for the various types of legislation in the social sphere which the commission is planning as well as for those initiatives which the commission is planning with regard to dialogue between the two sides of industry 
we need to see which concrete alternatives the commission will adopt during the coming period and which initiatives it will take for the purpose of reaching agreements 
firstly i agree with you entirely 
account will be taken of the information society that was something which i too mentioned 
social exclusion the programme for women the efforts we are making in the social protection area everything needs to be looked at now in the light of the new reality of the information society 
secondly there will obviously be timetables for the initiatives within which systematic monitoring will also have to be implemented 
where i cannot commit myself is on your reference to legislative work in the social security area which as you know is not included in the articles of the treaty and there is no legal basis for social security questions in the treaty 
since the author is not present question no lapses 
subject opportunities of the disabled to take advantage of freedom of movement within the eu under article of the amsterdam treaty it should be possible for all eu citizens to take advantage of freedom of movement within the union 
however for people with various kinds of physical disability who are in need of special transport and personal assistance freedom of movement is still highly restricted 
what measures is the commission taking to facilitate opportunities for the disabled in this area 
on november the european commission approved a package of measures to combat discrimination 
as far as the package in question and people with special needs are concerned there is a directive which concentrates on combating discrimination especially in the workplace 
the european commission believes that this initiative to combat discrimination will help to increase the level of employment of people with special needs and in the end to promote the freedom of movement of these persons 
of course it is particularly important for people with special needs to have access to means of transport services and all types of installation if they are to exercise their right to freedom of movement 
the european commission has approved a proposal for a directive on special arrangements in buses coaches and other vehicles so that people with special needs with mobility problems and people using wheelchairs have access to them 
in addition you should know that on june the council approved the recommendation for a pan-european type of parking permit to be introduced for people with special needs the aim of which is to help them travel in all member states with a common permit so that they can take advantage of all organised parking areas throughout europe 
i would thank the commissioner for her answer 
my question in the first place concerns the opportunities the disabled have to take advantage of freedom of movement in europe 
it is quite an expensive business if you are to travel from gothenburg to somewhere else in europe on holiday or on a study visit if you are in a wheelchair and also need to have a personal assistant or carer with you in order to manage 
i am grateful for the fact that the commission has adopted an action plan 
it is of course a prerequisite however that there be financial resources and means of actually crossing the borders physically if you have a disability 
it would be interesting to hear whether the commission is also prepared to set aside financial resources for those who have disabilities so that they too might venture further out into the world than merely to where their wheelchairs take them 
i referred to the directive which the commission has proposed on compulsory arrangements for means of public transport so that people with special needs can use them 
it has not yet been passed by the council it is at the consultation stage 
i think that a strategic decision of this sort can be taken at european level 
i think it is exceptionally difficult for us to specialise in aid programmes for personal transport 
that is dealt with either under special programmes in education for young people for women and for exchanges or must be a matter for national policy 
the draft legislation before the folketing does not contain any rules governing rights of employed persons under collective agreements 
however such use of an agreement outside its specific scope cannot be imposed on the two sides of industry without a legal basis 
there are therefore two possible solutions either the directive is inapplicable in denmark or denmark is required by the directive to introduce universally applicable agreements 
if not will it explain how the directive is to be complied with in this area 
the european union posting of workers directive stipulates that the compulsory rules concerning the terms and conditions of employment applicable in the host country must also apply to workers posted to that country 
what it says it that one of two things may apply i.e either the legislation in the host country or the collective agreements which have been declared to be the rules universally applicable to a specific sector 
because denmark does not have a system for declaring collective agreements to be universally applicable rules provision must be made in the implementing legislation so that apart from current conditions of employment stipulated in legislation the hours in universally applicable collective agreements concluded by the most representative organisations also apply to posted workers 
in other words to put it simply denmark has a choice it can either introduce legislation or it can use the legislative process to choose a collective agreement and legally activate it 
discussions are being held between the european commission and denmark and denmark is expected to notify the commission of the transposition of this directive into its national legislation 
we are waiting to see what the next move will be 
thank you for a very clear answer the gist of which if the interpretation is correct is that the posting of workers directive entails an obligation on the part of the danish state to establish a system of universally applicable agreements 
it is a very clear answer but it is also an answer may i point out which puts danish organisations the danish government and the danish parliament in a very very difficult situation politically for it is a well-known fact that there are a number of basic problems associated with the relationship between the danish model which is based quite obviously upon collective agreements and the continental model which presupposes legislation 
the disagreement and the correspondence to which you refer commissioner concern first and foremost another directive namely the working time directive but now we can foresee another letter of formal notice and further treaty infringement proceedings looming because the danish government does not intend or has expressly stated that it does not wish to implement legislation and establish universally applicable agreements 
firstly no attempt is being made to change the system in denmark or in any other country 
as i said earlier there are always problems interpreting the directives of the european commission both because they have a very general framework and because systems are very different from one country to another 
as far as your question is concerned this problem does not only apply to denmark 
it is not only denmark which has matters pending 
five countries have transposed this into national legislation and the rest are at the discussion stage 
what now needs to be done and this was the reason for the consultations and discussions between the commission and the danish government and with other governments is to find the best way forward so that something which is decided at european level by all the member states and which constitutes a general framework can also include workers posted to denmark from other countries 
and this is the direction in which we expect the danish and the other nine governments to move 
thank you very much commissioner for your dedication 
you have fulfilled your objective for today which is to answer all the questions 
we congratulate you 
since the time allocated to questions to the commission has elapsed questions to will be replied to in writing 
that concludes question time 
the commissioner mrs schreyer is not here yet but i hope and expect that she will arrive in the next few minutes 
mr president i am sure that mrs schreyer must have a very good reason for not being here because her absence would be inexcusable otherwise 
i would like to start by thanking my colleagues for their cooperation on this report it would not be what it is today without that spirit of cooperation 
mr president early last year the discharge was postponed because this parliament could not possibly grant discharge to a resigning commission which could not enter into any commitments for the future 
in its resolution this parliament stated that discharge could not be granted until we had received serious far-reaching proposals for reform from the new european commission 
it is an excellent opportunity for this parliament to introduce far-reaching reforms to these plans 
in the period leading up to this it already appeared on the basis of the initial drafts that the commission had made very important pledges 
parliament wanted financial inspection and audit functions to be separated 
this has now been done 
parliament requires a code of conduct for commissioners and cabinets 
this is in place too 
parliament asked the commission to waive its excessive privileges 
it did this as well 
the commission has also entered into commitments to cooperate with parliament in terms of sem 
fundamental changes will also be considered for the technical assistance offices 
these are sound first steps which illustrate that if this parliament so wishes changes are not only possible but can also be translated into action quickly 
we want more than that however 
the commission should now produce an ambitious and far-reaching reform programme 
this is not only necessary for proper public administration it is a conditio sine qua non of regaining the trust of the european citizen 
we now demand from the european commission clear pledges concerning the following points 
firstly parliament must have complete access to all commission documents 
this however presupposes that we set up an internal scheme quickly in order to be able to guarantee the confidentiality of sensitive documents 
if the current draft is correct then this is a huge step backwards in comparison to today 
we must put an end to the situation in which financially powerful organisations with representation in brussels are able to access information whilst the ordinary citizen is not 
neither can we tolerate a situation in which a public body holds the copyright to public documents 
we would also like a clear job description for each european official so that an official with conscientious objections can more easily object to tasks which are unethical or unlawful 
furthermore it should be the case that if the court of auditors detects a mistake not just one year but two years running the management should be held responsible for it and this will have an effect on chances of promotion 
ultimately we also need to achieve better cooperation of course between the european court of auditors and its national counterparts 
this parliament has also asked the commission to give an initial outline of the external aid policy reforms on march of this year 
it should no longer be the case that although europe is an economic power we have no political influence because when the chips are down we cannot offer effective aid to areas which desperately need it 
i would quote gaza as an example 
it is unacceptable that the commission completed the construction of a hospital in and that as yet it has been left unused 
mr president since the discharge has acquired a heavy political significance 
it is one of the most powerful weapons parliament has and must therefore be deployed with care 
this is why we will most probably grant the discharge tomorrow 
however we are not surrendering this weapon without placing a time bomb in its place 
indeed the discharge will not be given until all financial irregularities highlighted by the court of auditors have been cleared up 
finally this discharge report is naturally addressed to the commission 
but this does not detract from the fact that the european parliament should also put its own house in order 
as long as we have no status we are not credible as a force for reforming the union 
we cannot have a decisive and fair europe unless it is also open and democratic 
all institutions must now join forces in order to work together towards building this type of europe 
mr president the committee on industry decided to go ahead and draw up a report on the discharge for although we were not specifically asked to do so 
we went ahead because we felt we should start this parliament in the way in which we mean to go on that is by making sure that we take good care of taxpayers' money in europe 
during the course of our work on this report it became clear that there are persistent problems in the spending areas under the control of our budget 
they were not unique to and two strands seem to run through them 
the first is a tendency for the commission to embark on very ambitious programmes particularly in third countries without sufficient assessment of the practicalities of implementation and proper resourcing 
the second involves serious managerial shortcomings in the commission in particular in relation to coordination across departments and management of external contracts 
i know that all the institutions bear some responsibility for the increasing workload of the commission and for some of the lack of resources 
that cannot excuse everything that we came across 
citizens of europe expect the european institutions to be properly managed and they are right to do so 
that is why i want to echo the comments from my colleague about the importance of the reform process which has been promised to the people of europe by mr prodi and mr kinnock 
from what i have seen of the reform process it looks good 
i saw some of mr kinnock's papers today i heard some of what he had to say 
i have every confidence that if we and the politicians of europe support him we will see the kind of reform we need 
but we need that reform process 
many of the general points raised in our committee's report have been covered in mrs van der laan's report 
it is an excellent report and we should all congratulate her on it 
it seems to hit on all the right points without just being like some of the old reports a series of details 
it groups them together and that is very important 
there are two issues i would like to draw your attention to 
one is nuclear safety in eastern europe 
we have to get this right 
the committee of independent experts said the commission was not managing this properly 
we have to remedy that 
the second point is about scrutiny mechanisms 
we need from the commission material we can use to help us scrutinise spending 
we need proper information given in a proper way and we all have to take this whole process a lot more seriously than in the past 
it has been seen as a bureaucratic process to be done as quickly as possible in as little time as possible 
i hope colleagues in this house will support the grounds for discharge for and at the same time that the commission will push ahead with the reform process which is long overdue 
only in this way can we create a new culture in the commission and at the same time get public confidence restored 
mr president parliament now has to reach a decision in plenary sitting on whether to grant the commission the discharge for the financial year that was refused on may last year 
therefore we must ask what has changed against a background that is truly historic as far as the eu is concerned 
what improvements have there been 
what is there to justify granting the discharge today 
first of all there is to some extent in any event a new commission 
there has been a plethora of declarations of intent and announcements to do with reform none of which have a great deal of substance to them 
so far no consideration has been given to creating codes of conduct for members of the commission and their cabinets 
i have taken note of what mrs schreyer had to say this morning on the complaint against the two banks and the support for creating protection under criminal law of the financial interests of the eu 
these are also positive signs 
nevertheless it has to be said that these will cost the commission relatively little 
the commission has announced that it will present its reform programme in february 
announcements and declarations of intent are one thing fulfilling promises quite another 
we have been able to take stock since may and our conclusions offer no compelling reasons whatsoever for forming a decision on the granting of discharge 
if nevertheless discharge is granted to the commission for the financial year this then will mean that we will once again be giving them a major vote of confidence 
in addition and after all this is important as far as the general impression held by the people is concerned there is the fact that so far at least as far as i know the court of auditors has been unable to deliver a positive statement of assurance since this instrument was introduced 
nevertheless i would advocate granting discharge for and also call upon my fellow meps to decide in favour for in so doing we would be setting down a clear marker for a fresh start as well as giving the present commission the opportunity to make a fresh start which would also be apparent to the outside world in terms of coping with its admittedly onerous legacy 
furthermore this would entail continuing to track down and resolve once and for all any irregularities or incidences of fraud 
if the commission is now to be granted discharge for then under no circumstances should this be interpreted to mean a clean bill of health for the past or carte blanche for poor financial management in the future for it is known that friendship does not extend to money matters 
this expression also holds true for the relationship between citizens and european institutions 
and friendship which means confidence in the reliability of the work of the european institutions in this context is something we have more need of today than ever before 
it is above all the forthcoming enlargement of the eu to include the states of central and eastern europe that will produce far-reaching problems and impose burdens on internal structures and administrative developments 
unfortunately in the past particularly in the year under review problems have tended to arise in those assisted areas which are set to accrue greater importance when enlargement takes place for example the structural funds and the deployment of technical assistance offices 
we must put a stop to this unacceptable situation with all haste for we cannot ask something of the new member states that we cannot deliver ourselves nor does it help matters when the commission and member states point the finger at each other in turn and pass the buck from one to another 
as rapporteur for the budget i would like to give advance warning that in the course of the next few weeks and months i intend to keep a very close eye on how and whether the commission implements its reform proposals and how it shapes relations with parliament in this very area 
mr president i am sure the commission will be relieved to hear that the discharge is unlikely to have the same impact as the discharge which as you are all so very well aware led to the forced resignation of the santer commission 
the socialist group will be voting to grant discharge 
i am sure you will be relieved to hear that as well 
but that is not to say that we are satisfied and that everything in the garden is rosy 
it is clear that a radical overhaul of the commission is long overdue 
it indicates however that we acknowledge that steps are being made in the right direction 
i just want to outline some of the issues that we as socialists have put down as amendments 
we hope these will be carried because they are important in the way that they will impact on future reform 
first of all the immunity of officials this should be lifted if and when requested by a national prosecutor 
we need to make it much easier to prosecute officials who are guilty of fraud and corruption 
it is critical to note that the commission has too often failed to act on the reforms recommended by the court of auditors 
the court's report is there for a reason our response to it is there for a reason and it is important that it is followed through 
i have just heard now that an audit progress board is going to be set up by the commission 
even if we hear nothing else we know that is going in the right direction in terms of the reforms that we want to see 
too often we have put forward recommendations and they have not been acted upon even though you have said very often that you will act on them 
we want to see that follow-through to a much greater extent in future 
the other issue is access to confidential documents 
we have had problems in the past in terms of our responsibility in carrying out discharge because we have not had access to the documents we should have had 
we understand that we also have a responsibility here that if we are given documents we must ensure that confidential documents will indeed be kept confidential 
we have put down an amendment to that effect 
one issue which is referred to in the van der laan report is the whole question of the gaza hospital 
the situation there is totally unacceptable 
we will not put up with it for much longer and we are looking for immediate action on that issue 
i would like to congratulate lousewies van der laan 
i do not usually bother congratulating people but i think she has produced a very cogent report and deserves our thanks 
mr president commissioner if we are honest we find ourselves in a somewhat unusual situation 
i would like to raise the problems which are still piled up high on our desks 
the assessment of whether or not the discharge will be granted also depends to some extent on where the emphasis is placed 
it is about a commission which is no more 
there is now a new commission 
then it is logical to grant discharge because how can the current commissioner be blamed where is concerned 
the problems remain and this gives rise to doubts 
mr kinnock will present his proposal next month 
we are all very much anticipating this but the facts are still missing at this time when we already have to decide whether or not to grant discharge 
it is clearly a dilemma with which the rapporteur has also struggled 
this dilemma stretches beyond the areas which i have already listed 
take for example the pledges made by the commission 
they look good in themselves 
i have read a few documents written by mr kinnock and we have every confidence in them 
but i will give two examples from which it is not as evident that the good intentions which the commission has now expressed will lead to a good outcome the public nature and confidentiality of documents 
the previous speaker already said something about this 
a document is circulating at the moment not at a low level but at a high level within the commission which instead of enhancing the public nature of documents is having the opposite effect 
this is an illustration of empty pledges not necessarily leading to good results 
this also applies to whistle-blowers 
mr kinnock has also devoted some fine-sounding phrases to this subject but at the same time it is entirely unclear at this moment when we have to make a decision what for example happens with whistle-blowers who want to get something off their chest and cannot do this internally but who want to address the outside world the press or parliament 
we have still not had a response to crucial questions of this type 
so there is doubt as to whether these pledges of the commission contain enough substance at this crucial time when decisions need to be made 
this also applies for example to the very real projects which the committee on industry has introduced 
in my opinion the commission and mr kinnock should come with good intentions and with sound plans on personnel policy and financial management but each commissioner who is now responsible for an area which has had serious shortcomings in the past should come with sound plans in order to improve the situation and not with general empty proposals 
at the moment our group still feels sympathy for and patience with the commission because it cannot be held responsible for a large proportion of the mistakes made in the past but this patience has a limit 
clear progress must be visible 
at present we trust that the commission will produce these sound proposals but it is not a foregone conclusion that it will do so 
finally mr president the discharge was the beginning of the end of the last commission 
i express the hope that in fact i urge the present commission to ensure that the discharge is the beginning of a true reform of financial policy by the commission 
otherwise this discharge will not have been of any value 
in assessing the question of whether or not to grant the commission discharge the decision must be based upon what actually occurred during the financial year concerned in this case in the course of 
in our group we find it hard to see how the financial administration for was in any crucial way better than that for 
in that year we voted against granting discharge 
as a result we shall vote against granting discharge for too 
we think that this picture of ours is confirmed by the examination carried out by the court of auditors 
it is both good and necessary that reforms have been promised 
so far the promises which have been made are still however to be fulfilled especially where transparency is concerned 
we are therefore going to vote in favour of the demands for reforms which are presented in the resolution but against the granting of discharge 
the union for a europe of nations group cannot vote for approving the accounts for 
the report on so-called discharge contains a comprehensive and extremely critical survey of the accounts 
we support these critical remarks and i must therefore state that it would seem quite absurd against this background to vote in favour of approving the accounts 
we do not think that the new commission under any circumstances could incur liability for the past 
the mistakes up until are attributable to those who had responsibility at that time and we still have no way of knowing whether the new commission can do any better 
by means of this extraordinary procedure parliament is stopping itself from placing liability for the arrangements in squarely where it belongs namely with the previous commission 
it was the accounts which led to the downfall of the previous commission and the accounts are just as incriminating 
there is no reason why against this background we should agree to grant discharge 
as far as the decision to balance the accounts is concerned we shall abstain from voting and where finally the motion for a resolution is concerned we shall attach most importance to the many correct instructions contained in this and vote in favour of it 
mr president the decision relating to discharge for the financial year was postponed because the erstwhile commission to whom it was to be granted had stepped down before the appointed time and was only continuing in office in a caretaker capacity 
that is just the way things are however 
in taking over the mandate the new commission has to assume responsibility not just for the achievements of the past but also for the mistakes made 
since on account of the college system discharge can only be granted to the commission as a whole or alternatively denied or postponed it is no longer of any consequence that four former commissioners who belonged to the previous commission that has yet to be discharged crop up again as members of this body 
this question ought to have been asked when the new commission was appointed 
the comments contained within under eight headings are an integral part of the discharge the implementation of which forms the basis of our decision 
in the course of the discharge procedure for the coming years that for is already under way parliament will have to examine as a matter of urgency whether or not it was too quick to bestow premature praise on the commission for 
we will be in a position to judge just as soon as the commission presents its reform programme 
we will be able to use the discharge procedure for to check whether efficiency transparency and accountability and likewise a sincere willingness to provide information are being displayed vis-à-vis the discharge authority 
mr president mrs van der laan recommends that we grant discharge for the financial year and we interpret this as an act of good faith towards the new commission as previous speakers have already said 
this discharge is to be granted pending a commitment from the commission to undertake sweeping reforms that is what it says in recital of the motion for a resolution 
anyone however who believes that regardless of the fact that discharge was refused for the discharge for will make everything rosy in the garden again is very much mistaken 
as far as i am concerned the all-important question as to how willing the new commission actually is to submit itself and its officials to supervision by parliament and the judiciary has gone unanswered 
let me give you an example one of the first issues we were confronted with as the newly-constituted committee on budgetary control was the fléchard case which involved fraud in connection with the export of butter to the former soviet union at the beginning of the' 
on january high-ranking officials in the commission took the decision to largely waive the penalty which the company concerned was actually due to pay and which amounted to almost eur million 
this was an outright violation of community regulations in force and the first we knew of it was when an anonymous notice was sent at the end of 
everything i have heard members of the prodi commission say on the subject hitherto boils down to a plea to stop poking around in things that happened long ago and to look to the future instead 
the enormity of it all is that a director-general and a number of directors who were involved at the time have declared themselves innocent of the fact that unfortunately the minutes for the crucial meeting of january have inexplicably disappeared 
it is claimed that there was not just one copy of these minutes but rather that there were several copies 
it is said that whilst each participant received his or her own copy sadly none of these can now be found none of them 
now more than ever before we can no longer say forget it 
this is also one of those cases that should be referred to the competent judicial authorities since when all is said and done allowing documents and minutes to disappear is no trivial offence but is expressly made a punishable offence in article of the belgian criminal code 
all i can say is that we will no doubt take up this theme again during the discharge procedure for 
mr president we all recall that parliament decided to postpone the discharge for the financial year pending commitments from the new european commission regarding internal reform 
in response to this the commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures 
it is fair to say that the new president mr prodi and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this parliament 
however the reform of the european commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming intergovernmental conference and the reform of various eu policies and initiatives 
existing eu treaties will be amended so as to ensure for example that the enlargement process can succeed 
i have no doubt further reform of eu institutions will be analysed in this debate 
but from the perspective of small member states it is important that as the european commission is reformed it must be done in a way that ensures that small member states continue to have representation on the commission 
mr president the commission is now to obtain its discharge for but in reality it does not deserve it 
was a matter for the old commission and therefore the new commission does not think that it can accept liability 
the new commission has on the other hand undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals and i must admit that i am not impressed at all 
there are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start 
i do not however think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly 
i am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving echo 
i am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter 
i am the rapporteur for echo on the committee on budgetary control and i shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the commission will not give me the necessary information 
from the outside it looks as if the commission has something to hide 
my investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case 
the commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the commission 
i can therefore fully support the demand to give parliament unconditional right of access to documents 
otherwise we cannot carry out our work 
mr president rapporteur ladies and gentlemen i hope that i am able to answer the question as to whether we deserve to have the discharge granted in the affirmative 
it is of course the discharge procedure for the budget together with the report from the court of auditors that act as a source of information for the tax payers of the european union as to whether and to what extent budgetary funds were spent thriftily and in accordance with political priorities where errors occurred but above all what kind of measures are being introduced to remedy the situation 
the general public knows that the european parliament is not treating the discharge procedure as a routine matter but is giving it every attention and the commission has also been aware of this since last year when discharge was denied which is what led to the resignation of the previous commission 
it has dealt with virtually all the important issues that the commission is concerned with in the broader sense 
the report is very ambitious 
it focuses on the reform measures that were introduced and above all on those that will need to be introduced 
i would like mrs van der laan to congratulate you on what is indeed a very ambitious report 
i would now like to look more closely at a number of points contained in the report 
firstly the issue that rightly occupies a substantial amount of our time that of externalisation of tasks 
we have debated this at great length in committee and also in the framework of the budgetary procedure for the year 
the commission has promised parliament that it will introduce measures in this regard in the very near future 
foreign policy is the area that has most relevance to that of the technical assistance offices 
my fellow commissioner mr chris patten together with the other commissioners responsible for foreign policy set up a review group only at the end of last year which is to undertake a very swift analysis of the tasks performed by the current technical assistance offices and consider which of the tasks should be carried out in a different form in future 
the group has undertaken to submit specific foreign policy proposals shortly after submitting the global reform package 
the commission is unlikely to be able to submit a detailed proposal on this specific point as early as march but we hope to be able to do so very soon thereafter 
you emphasised the global approach in your report 
this global approach is part of the reform package 
however i also wanted to mention that concrete measures are being prepared which are in line with the report by mr bourlanges and which are specifically intended for this sphere of foreign policy 
it is the aim of other demands in the report to increase transparency 
the commission wants openness and believes that it should only refuse your chamber access to information where there is a need to preserve interests meriting protection 
i am confident that it will be possible to resolve these issues in the interinstitutional agreement 
the commission also intends to improve the information content of your accounts above and beyond existing legal requirements at your request and that of the court of auditors 
i undertook back in the debate on the court of auditors' report to take up this point which also features in this report namely carrying out a systematic follow-up because i consider it to be necessary 
the commission has already decided on the basis of my submission that the auditors are to take responsibility for looking after the accounts including those for in such a way that they take on board the court of auditors' criticism that is to say advance payments are to be itemised separately so as to keep this information to hand 
the fight against fraud must be stepped up still further 
we briefly discussed olaf this morning 
i would just like to again mention the staffing increase for which provision has been made in budget 
mrs stauner the complaint i referred to this morning has not only just been announced in fact it has already been submitted 
i believe this also testifies to the fact that the commission is not prepared to tolerate certain institutions wanting to back out of this regulation which was passed by parliament and the council rather it applies equally to every single one of the institutions of the european community 
finally you call for dialogue to be improved more dialogue with the member states about necessary improvements in those areas where they have the power of decision over community funds 
i also second your demands on this point and will see to it that the commission does what it can to have them implemented 
as far as the issues surrounding the gaza hospital and the palestinian parliament are concerned i am able to tell you that the gaza hospital will be open and available to out-patients as of july and to in-patients from october 
secondly the commission will inform the european parliament about the progress made in relation to the hospital and in relation to the selection of the consultants who are to prepare the invitations to tender for the construction of the palestinian parliament 
all the reform measures i have mentioned are part of a global approach 
mr kinnock is to present the global approach to you on behalf of the commission and will talk about political priorities of this period of office and enlarge upon the need for firm and above all verifiable and comprehensible scheduling 
implementation of these plans should make the european union and its institutions by and large more powerful and transparent 
the commission is very well aware of how resolutely and scrupulously the european parliament is exercising this supervision 
all the more reason for me to be pleased that the reform measures we have introduced meet with your approval and that you are prepared to form a positive judgement of the discharge procedure for 
thank you commissioner schreyer 
the debate is closed 
the vote will take place tomorrow at p.m 
mr president this time last year the european parliament set up a committee of independent experts chaired by mr middelhoek to investigate allegations of fraud nepotism and corruption in the european commission 
on march the committee published its first report concluding that it is becoming difficult to find anyone who has even the slightest sense of responsibility 
within a few hours of the presentation of the report president santer announced the resignation of his entire team 
the resignation marked the end of a bitter struggle between an increasingly confident parliament and a european commission mired in allegations of scandal 
since then the brussels landscape has changed beyond recognition a new reinvigorated parliament has been elected and a new commission confirmed in office 
speaking in this house on july president-designate prodi undertook to take full account of the second report of the committee of independent experts on commission reform which contains detailed recommendations and which we are debating today 
the new commission has already taken important steps to move away from the way it used to function 
a code of conduct for commissioners and their private offices has been adopted 
in a symbolic but significant gesture commissioners have voluntarily renounced their entitlement to the tax-free purchase of alcohol tobacco petrol and consumer goods 
new rules have been drawn up and implemented governing the appointment of senior officials 
the number of departments has been reduced 
the commission in my opinion has shown a clear and unprecedented commitment to change and for this they are to be congratulated 
the overall aim of the reforms must be to create a strong honest european public administration equipped to carry out its tasks in an effective and efficient manner an administration in which officials are provided with the means to carry out their tasks and are held fully accountable at all levels an administration that recognises and rewards merit and encourages officials to develop their full potential 
in order to achieve this action is required in four areas 
first financial management and control within the commission must be improved 
one of the main problems is the lack of a functioning system of financial control 
the commission's dgs must be made fully responsible for their own expenditure including financial control 
a new independent audit system service must be set up 
dgs must publish their own annual accounts so as to enable a clear identification of problem areas and set annual targets for reducing fraud and irregularities 
in return for this greater degree of autonomy managers must be made fully and personally responsible for their actions 
it is clear that the transition to such a new system will take time 
changes to the financial regulation will be required and parliament must have its say on those changes 
but while the commission must ensure that it respects the treaty and the financial regulation in the transitional phase this must not be an excuse for inertia 
urgent change is required today 
second the fight against fraud mismanagement and nepotism must be strengthened firstly by creating a culture in which they cannot thrive 
this requires a clear example to be set by commissioners and senior staff as well as adequate training and secondly by reinforcing the existing mechanisms for dealing with fraud 
olaf the commission agency set up earlier this year must be placed under the direction of an independent european public prosecutor whose job will be to prepare for prosecution by national criminal courts criminal offences committed against the financial interests of the union by members and officials of the european institutions 
a proposal can be made a proposal should be made on the basis of article of the treaty by the middle of this year 
third standards in european public life must be upheld 
the political crisis which led to the downfall of the commission earlier this year clearly demonstrated the need for unambiguous and enforceable rules of conduct 
a number of codes have since been introduced 
they must be assessed by parliament and should be made legally binding 
the european institutions should follow the example of a number of countries most notably the united kingdom and institute a committee for standards in public life with a mandate to give advice on professional ethics and rules of conduct in the european institutions 
whistle-blowers who act in good faith must be protected 
at the end of last year mr kinnock announced new measures for the protection of whistle-blowers 
they must be implemented without delay 
although such measures can never be an alternative for good management they must be an escape valve when something goes wrong 
crucially reforms must not be limited to the commission 
parliament must consider itself the need for improvements to its internal rules administrative procedures and management practices 
finally the commission's human resource policy must be modernised 
it is clearly no longer suited to the requirements of a modern multinational organisation 
the social dialogue has often acted as a brake on reform and its overhaul is long overdue 
a career with the european institutions must become more attractive 
too many young new officials are leaving their jobs after just a few years 
merit must be recognised and rewarded specific skills training should be a sine qua non for promotion to a higher grade 
the promotions procedure must be made fairer and more transparent 
last but not least the pay and benefits package must be reviewed 
it must become more flexible and more responsible to labour market conditions 
it must be rid of some of its more outdated elements and it must deal with the legitimate concerns of the general public who cannot understand why european civil servants should be paid an expatriation allowance indefinitely in a europe of open borders or pay a level of taxes that is often well below that of member states 
commissioner kinnock will tomorrow present his communication on reform 
this communication must contain a clear timetable 
with a new commission and a new parliament up and running the momentum for reform is now as strong as it ever has been and probably ever will be 
enlargement of the union is just a few years away 
now is the time for europe to put its own house in order to instil in its institutions as the independent experts might have said a sense of responsibility 
in june of last year europe's voters gave a clear signal that they are fed up with endless stories about mismanagement and nepotism 
there is a very simple way to deal with those stories 
let us get rid of mismanagement and nepotism 
mr president i do not want to be misunderstood i sincerely hope this does not happen and i should therefore like to start by saying that i am of course in favour of combating fraud and firmly support the appropriate necessary reforms 
this is not a straightforward issue and calls for a much more wide-ranging analysis but i shall restrict myself to raising only a few points in order to make people more aware if possible of what we are talking about 
all the experts can provide information and news formulate opinions and give advice but they have no political or elective responsibility and rightly so 
i nevertheless believe that politicians should look into what can be gleaned from an expert report and what cannot be taken en masse in a spirit which on some occasions i have felt in the past and still feel to be self-destructive 
i believe and i shall only pick up on a few ideas that parliament alone and no one else can exert an influence over its members 
it is just as important for no-one to be able to or have to refuse the european parliament or its committees any documentation 
members of parliament must possess the qualities of morality discipline and discretion over delegated issues innately and these certainly cannot be imposed on them by anyone else 
i would point out that there is no european legal system but that a different legal system exists in each member state 
we run the risk of delegating issues relating to the same offences which will then be punished in different ways 
i agree that an investigation system should be introduced but i am also absolutely convinced that we must recognise the right to equal respect for dignity and in any case the equal need for the right to a defence 
i am opposed to european community officials being accused of criminal acts at the drop of a hat whistle-blowing is a method that has no place in the third millennium 
in conclusion mr president parliament must introduce a principle of democracy we must implement reforms which allow parliament to grow and expand its powers not go into reverse 
this debate on the van hulten report brings to a close one of the most traumatic periods for the european institutions since their creation in 
the refusal of the european parliament to grant discharge and the definitive refusal for the budget the motion of censure tabled in this house a year ago for differing reasons and the first report of the committee of independent experts on the reform of the commission which led to the mass resignation of the commission itself are now part of european folklore 
those of us involved in these historic events are well aware that none of the upheaval would have been caused had we not acted with parliamentary power to press for changes in the way in which the commission operated 
remember that the council of ministers absent again this evening from our debate approved the discharge not the on the very day the commission itself resigned on march 
now we come to the second report of the committee of independent experts which we already had the opportunity to welcome and briefly debate last september 
our greatest concern in the epp is to ensure that public confidence in the european commission is restored 
further steps to build a strong europe will be to no avail if the european peoples perceive that there is no adequate system of democratic accountability for over-zealous officials 
under no circumstances will we concede ground which we have won over the past few months which we believe to be in the interests of openness and transparency 
we are therefore concerned to see the flurry of commission announcements in recent weeks by commissioner kinnock suggesting policy proposals of various kinds to be put in a white paper shortly 
while conveying a desire to proceed rapidly it also gives the impression that the commission is in transmission rather than listening mode 
our concern is strengthened if the rumour reported a few days ago is true namely that the commission wants to limit severely the access of parliament to information 
this was after all one of the causes of the downfall of the last commission 
have the lessons not been learnt 
the knowledge that the framework relations between the european parliament and the european commission still remain to be negotiated led to our disagreement with the rapporteur when we debated his report in committee 
we could in no way agree with his view that it would be demeaning for parliament to set out detailed instructions as to what we wanted the commission to take up in its reform package 
the less precise mr van hulten we are in our resolutions the more room it gives the commission and your former colleagues in the council to do what they like 
we have resubmitted a few amendments which fell in committee in particular our desire to see the codes of conduct revised specifically to include the reference to merit and managerial capacity which you commissioner accepted when we had our hearings last september should be included in these codes of conduct particularly when considering appointments and promotion 
looking to the future we know that we are at the beginning of a long process of continuing reform in the european commission 
we want in particular to see the hard-working and highly competent norm for commission officials acknowledged in the outside world a reputation that has been darkened by the inappropriate conduct of a few individuals 
commissioner you will be aware from your presence in the last commission why the crisis occurred 
in a nutshell there were programmes being run for which there were insufficient staff resources available 
we urge you to take the opportunity to establish the real staffing needs of the commission based on the essential activities for which it is responsible 
our position was made very clear on this topic in the budget 
we will be vigilant over the next five years to ensure the reforms now being suggested are fully implemented and will support efforts made to modernise institutions 
but equally we will not hesitate to withdraw our support financially or otherwise should steps be taken which do not correspond to the openness promised by commission president romano prodi prior to his nomination 
let us hope that we can avoid institutional upheavals by having an ongoing dialogue which assumes from the outset that parliament will be an equal partner in deciding the outcome of commission reform 
mr president i must start by apologising that i cannot be nearly as dramatic as mr elles in my presentation 
can i first thank mr van hulten for this report 
it is an excellent report 
it would have been wrong for parliament to have put in willy nilly every single recommendation that came from an external body because parliament should have its own opinion on these issues 
it is right for us to have a focused report which is what mr van hulten has produced 
can i invite mr elles not to put the cart before the horse 
yes a lot of things were lost by the socialists but they have not been won in plenary yet and may i warn him that may not be the case tomorrow 
i should like to thank commissioner kinnock for all his efforts so far 
he has been clear that his commitment has been to produce a radical change 
central to this is the attempt to produce and engender responsibility 
it is clear that this needs to be developed at all levels and it needs to recognise the needs of each level within the commission 
it is clear that we need to see a change in the financial regulation 
that is important 
we need to stop people passing the buck from one to another 
where failure is occurring within the commission we need to hold people responsible 
we need to be assured that consistent under-performance must lead to dismissal 
this is natural elsewhere but it seems to be an extremely radical suggestion when it is put to the commission 
we cannot continue with a situation where incompetence mismanagement and fraud are costing the european taxpayers money and providing them with a poor service 
i will give you one example of this 
in the court of auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to italian wine cost the taxpayers of europe gbp to million 
it is clear that is not acceptable 
what happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation 
we need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit 
we recognise that most of the officials within the commission are extremely hard-working 
but we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated 
we look forward to reading the full commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the commission because unlike what mr elles has just said the commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with parliament between now and march 
we also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones 
the european parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history 
we have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves 
our own staff policy is outdated 
some of our working practices need radical reform 
i hope that the european parliament will be hanging onto the coattails of the commission in this reform process 
we recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting 
we recognise that means discipline on the part of commission officials and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priorities 
finally can i say that the commission needs to work on its relationships with the public 
european taxpayers need to be re-assured 
the fate of the commission of the whole european union rests on delivery of this reform 
that is the key issue delivery of these proposals 
mr president i would like to start by extending my compliments to the rapporteur mr van hulten on his first report 
i very much admire him for keeping his spirits up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments 
i think that the report drawn up by the wise men has been useful and i think that it is also useful for this parliament as already stated by mrs morgan that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration is run 
we have submitted an amendment to this effect 
from the many points made by mr van hulten in his report i would like to highlight a few not necessarily in order of importance but just randomly 
firstly i think that the commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents 
we noticed this when we had to investigate the flechard affair which as it happens has still not been sorted out 
curiously very important documents had gone missing from the cabinets even from those of the president and of various directorates-general and this is clearly something which should not happen 
if parliament want to carry out proper inspections these documents must be available and i would like to know what the commission intends to do to improve this situation 
i would also like to say a few words about ex post financial control 
this has also been partly dealt with in the van hulten report 
i think it would be useful if we were to give report figures per category and per sector on how the budget is implemented 
the general impression at present is that anything budget-related within europe is bad 
it is clear that over the past couple of years we have noticed an upward trend in agriculture and a downward one in structural expenditure 
is this possible 
i would like to suggest to the commission that it prescribe a deadline by which the reforms have to be carried out 
if we admit new member states then we need to put our own house in order first 
mr president i would firstly like to thank mr van hulten 
it is his first report here in plenary 
this is worth a compliment although i regret of course that he did not expound it in his own mother tongue 
it is a report which came about with difficulty and may well be too late 
in my opinion this is mainly down to the wrangling between the two major groups within our committee on budgetary control 
let us be honest 
the second report of the wise men arrived in september 
we are now four months down the line 
meanwhile mr van hulten has been inundated with amendments more than amendments in the first round 
he went back to work rewrote his report and took into account the very many suggestions but had to face nearly another amendments in the second round 
my fear is that all of this has contributed to a report which is too detailed too extensive and too late 
moreover i have been informed that the commission has approved a report today of all days on the reform of the commission which will be distributed for further consultation to the various institutions and also to our parliament i hope 
might mr kinnock be able to throw some light on the matter this evening 
after all it makes no sense to copy the many sound recommendations made by the committee of wise men word for word in your report 
so tomorrow if we vote against some amendments or against specific paragraphs this is certainly not on account of their content but rather to render your report as a whole more readable 
in any case it should be clear that my group of course fully backs the recommendations made by the committee of wise men 
in any event i look forward to the document which was approved by the commission today 
i also look forward to the white paper which will be available in february 
i have to inform you commissioner that both the report of the wise men and that of mr van hulten will become gauges for our group gauges which should make it clear to us whether we can have confidence in the prodi commission or not 
i would like to end on the following point 
just as the white paper on food safety was approved last week and released to public opinion with a clear deadline stated we would request the same in connection with the new white paper on the reform of the commission 
i think that there is a need for this as public opinion is looking for change and in any event my group would like to see a clear change by the end of 
mr president this report is positive but actually we need more than this 
fraud mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere 
they are most likely to occur if there is little democratic control on cash flow 
via the structural funds a great deal of the european budget is being pumped around the system 
this is only useful as long as there is a sense of solidarity where rich member states contribute to both the revenue and development of poorer member states 
but there is also funding which is being pumped via brussels back to the same rich member states 
districts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hands on this by investing vast amounts of money and manpower in lobbying and negotiating 
after each incident of improper use of this money and certainly after fraud the call for stricter control is more pronounced 
even the strictest control cannot solve this problem 
it will at best lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involved in choosing and developing projects 
it would be preferable if national governments channelled this money directly to their local governments without a european detour 
in the next couple of years we will need to think about the possibility of replacing structural funds by an equalisation fund which is limited to budgetary aid for member states or their constituent regions with a low income per capita of the population 
this is probably the only way to achieve less fraud less overheads more transparency and more democracy 
mr president a year has not yet passed but it is already clear that parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently 
the first report was widely publicised formally debated and used just like the controversy and news leaks which preceded it to make mincemeat first of the president of the commission and then of the majority of the european commissioners even though they had no connection with fraud mismanagement or nepotism 
reading now what happened then not even a year ago it becomes clear that that first report was intended to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform as is maintained today so much so that this second report which on the other hand could have provided much more salient points was commissioned with the precise mandate not to address specific cases since there is no intention to follow up the offences detailed in this report 
it is of no concern to the major groups in parliament nor to the majority of the trade unions who are busy discussing the defence of european public administration but in practice are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members putting the wide powers afforded to them to dubious use 
trade union representatives sit on the disciplinary board and the staff regulations committee thereby making it impossible to remove disloyal officials and preserving the staff regulations in their fossilised state 
incomprehensibly trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition and i would not be surprised if union members were already members of olaf thereby placing this institution which should at least formally guarantee its impartiality at great risk 
i therefore understand why we are meeting at this time which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates discussions and the exchange of information 
mr president in the van hulten report parliament underlines the harsh necessity for a thorough reform of financial administration 
expenditure must be monitored much more closely both within the commission and the member states 
for this purpose the european court of auditors and national courts of auditors must work together more effectively 
there is also the need to set up a scheme for so-called whistle-blowers 
we fully support all these recommendations 
i would like to make some observations however 
one of the conclusions drawn by the committee of wise men is that the current legal framework for fighting fraud at the expense of the european union is incoherent and incomplete 
how should we deal with this 
this kind of procedure presupposes the existence of european criminal law and there is no such thing 
moreover this goes to the very heart of the member states' sovereignty 
we should therefore look to solve this problem by means of improved cooperation between the member states at judicial level 
it could be coordinated by a kind of european public prosecutor who is not involved in prosecution but passes criminal offences on to the national legal authorities 
also parliament should take up the gauntlet 
it is high time that regulations were drawn up for members and that travel expenses are reimbursed based on actual expenses 
the question arises as to whether parliament is in fact prepared to find a way out of this impasse 
this week the rothley opinion was discussed within the legal affairs committee and there was nothing to indicate any such willingness 
mr president when it comes to putting its own house in order the european commission is in a catch-22 situation 
there is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous commission 
i sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this chamber sound the more applause they receive 
there again it is simply not possible to change situations once and for all with a few strokes of the pen and the problems begin as soon as we have to start talking about implementation and getting down to brass tacks 
this may explain why we experienced more difficulties than anticipated in the committee on budgetary control as regards this issue 
nevertheless the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see and i would expressly like to thank mr van hulten for the work he has done on this report 
provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the commission on a number of crucial points 
allow me to start with the most important demand 
we do not want financial control to be abolished 
the financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made not in every case but wherever uncertainties or risks arise 
the commission is sending out the wrong signals here by renaming the directorate-general for financial control as the directorate-general for audits for example 
this cannot be ignored or evaded certainly not on account of soft law as was once suggested at a meeting of our committee 
irrespective of such legal considerations it would be an unforgivable mistake under the circumstances to scrap financial control in the traditional sense at the very moment when those responsible for such matters in the commission are at long last no longer out on a limb but set to become part of a chain of functioning supervisory and investigatory mechanisms 
as we see it there will be a dovetailing of three mechanisms in the future a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller concomitant and follow-up control by the internal audit service also known as the audit service which has yet to be set up and finally there will be the targeted tracking-down of irregularities by olaf the new anti-fraud office 
a few salient points the disciplinary procedures are not taking effect especially when it comes to calling officials to account for their misdemeanours including those of a financial nature 
there is a large grey area and a great lack of clarity where criminal sanctions are concerned and it is precisely in this area that the announcements made by the commission are rather vague 
i can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked 
mr president firstly i would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague mr van hulten 
it is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and i am i think entitled to feel a little proud of him 
i would in any case like to congratulate him on his report 
the call to make a cultural u-turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one 
i have witnessed from close up within the development committee how thousands of projects stagnate and how sometimes up to % of the money is not spent 
sometimes an enormous reservoir of money is created not because it is not desperately needed not because there are no sound proposals but because the whole system has collapsed 
a lack of responsibility too much ex ante not enough ex post and as a result far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending 
it would be marvellous if this report were to give the green light to result-oriented spending of this kind with all the work organised on that basis 
without any doubt this will then be a service mr president to the european public and by means of the results we produce we will also regain and re-acquire something which we have ostensibly lost over the past couple of years 
this is the best support we can give to european democracy 
if in this way we can move away from the culture of the fifties and cross over into the next century we are witnessing a very special moment indeed 
mr president first of all congratulations to michiel van hulten for his first report 
it was a baptism of fire but we have a saying in the netherlands appropriate for this occasion in at the deep end and you will swim in no time 
mr van hulten i think you deserve a medal for your efforts 
there are two points which in my opinion deserve special attention on the part of the eldr 
firstly there is the commissioners' individual responsibility 
this must be regulated during the igc 
however we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hands of the council and we have therefore submitted an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reached between the commission and parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall-back position and are not placing our fate completely in the hands of the council 
secondly as already mentioned by my colleague mr mulder the eldr is of the opinion that the european parliament should also be investigated by independent experts 
this will contribute hugely towards re-establishing the confidence of the european citizens in this institution 
we at the european parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reformed commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own house in order as well 
only when all european institutions are reformed will we have the open democratic and decisive europe which our citizens now finally deserve 
mr president i also wish to congratulate mr van hulten on this first piece of work which he is presenting to the house 
i am sure that it will serve amongst other things to make his second report more flexible and for him to step up efforts to find a consensus amongst the groups 
at this stage there can be no delay in the process of reforming the commission demanded by our citizens 
this parliament has often heard the desire to reform the commission expressed even by its presidents 
it now appears that this desire is more serious 
after the resignation of a commission and after a committee of experts has listed an almost endless number of deficiencies it makes sense that mr prodi should have promised on september to present this parliament with a complete plan for reform by february 
this parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform programme 
the report that we are debating today intends to give political force to many of the recommendations of the committee of experts commissioned by this parliament 
mr prodi said he would act anyway that he preferred to get things right but that fear of not getting things right would not prevent him from acting 
we therefore ask that his programme be a bold one and if it is i can assure him that he will have the support of this house in the reform process 
we want a strong commission which can act in an independent and neutral manner but with political sense 
commissioners should not be considered senior officials but rather politicians in office 
therefore the report allows them to be members of political parties and to be members of political bodies affiliated to their parties 
perhaps the reference to the posts is imprecise 
i do not know your exact view in this respect mr kinnock but it is clear that we want commissioners who are politically strong and politically committed 
we want a structure which allows every euro to be spent effectively and our accounts demonstrate that this is not happening at present 
therefore commissioner we ask mr prodi to present us with a bold programme and he will find that he has problems with those bodies who feel that their status quo is under threat but not with this parliament which expects profound and daring changes 
mr president the santer commission came to grief because financial control failed all down the line 
therefore the future of this new commission will depend in no small measure on the extent to which reforms are swiftly undertaken here and financial control is back in working order 
as far as this is concerned a number of people have already referred to the fact that the commission intends to drastically improve and consolidate its follow-up checks and that these checks should be carried out on a completely independent basis with no sweeping of matters under the carpet in future 
naturally this is only to be welcomed 
what i do not understand is why this has to come at a price as it were that is of having to dispense with independent and i stress independent prior approval 
and so it is the two key principle that applies here 
a single key is to suffice in future 
the financial controller is no longer to make advance checks if all goes to plan as regards the reforms currently under discussion within the commission 
if you will pardon me for saying so mr kinnock what you are proposing is a little like abolishing the police because they were unable to prevent crimes 
what we really need to focus on however is making the checks more effective 
this could be achieved by no longer insisting in future that the financial controllers furnish every single payment transaction with their approval stamp 
it is precisely those who feel the need to control everything that end up controlling nothing at all 
therefore in future prior approval should take place in a targeted manner that is only in cases of uncertainty or risk 
the officials responsible for financial control should be deployed on a decentralised basis that is in the operational directorates-general amongst those of their colleagues that spend the money so that they are immediately available when problems arise and so as to render the checks less ponderous and time-consuming 
however the financial controllers must work independently 
that is the crucial difference between our plans and those of the commission when it talks in terms of decentralisation 
surely we have learnt this much from the events surrounding the leonardo affair when the internal examiners in the relevant directorate-general issued warnings but these were neither heeded nor passed on 
therefore independence is prerequisite for effective checks 
that is the position which a clear majority of the committee on budgetary control subscribes to 
indeed the new commission has now declared itself in favour of follow-up checks having this independence and so would it not make sense for a system of prior approval to enjoy such independence as well 
mrs theato has already expressed as much and i am only too willing to support her in this regard 
mr president a couple of years ago the previous commission tried once and for all to tackle rigid and obsolescent structures 
this led to strikes and smear campaigns by intransigent trade unions whereupon the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a wishy-washy compromise 
this was stupid of the old commission and parliament was of no help on that occasion 
there are too many rights too many regulations and too little room for leadership 
there is no backbone and no teeth 
where is the beef 
and i would also say this to you commissioner please deliver the beef even if it is british 
romano prodi promised a revolution 
you have said some powerful and worthwhile things yourself but take care now that you do not dodge the crucial issues the ones where it hurts 
sort out the tangle of staff allowances 
stand firm on the demand for mobility not as a right as it says here in the report but as a management tool 
ensure too that training becomes a management tool 
it is the posts which should possibly be made permanent and not necessarily those employed on a temporary basis 
finally mr president as a member of the bureau until six months ago i would urge you to address this issue in the bureau so that we here in parliament at least comply in our own administration with the demands we are making on others 
we have not done this so far and this is something you ought to be instrumental in changing 
mr president i want to thank mr van hulten for his report and to say that i voted for it 
so i refer to the things i do not agree with 
i do not agree with the paragraphs in relation to parliament 
this report is about the commission 
parliament is a separate subject 
there is no need for us to bring parliament into the discussion on the commission 
in addition to that there is the question of duty-free 
that was a stick used to beat the commission by the duty-free lobbies who resented the fact that the commission abolished duty-free in airports 
it is not worthy of being brought into this report either 
most of the report is about financial control 
that is reasonable because it comes from the budgetary control committee 
but we should not create the impression that vast amounts of european resources are being put at risk by carelessness in the european commission 
after all it is only % of gdp by comparison with national spending 
we have had all that before but some people in this parliament are young and do not seem to understand how small the financial resources of the european union are and that % of these resources are spent by the member states 
so carelessness within the commission in the spending of money is not likely to put at risk vast quantities of money 
we should get it into perspective 
it is important to remember that 
the business of the european commission is very little about spending money 
they have very little of it 
they have a much wider responsibility 
that wider responsibility concerns the management of the environment food safety foreign trade the internal market and so many other responsibilities we have given them without the resources to deal with them 
i am not one of the people who agrees that there is a vast lack of trust 
if there is we have generated it in this house in the past year 
i have been here for years and found absolute trust between the council the commission and parliament 
we have had our problems and we recognised difficulties but there was not a situation where this bureaucratic commission was mistrusted doubted and feared by the citizens of the european union because they were mismanaging our affairs 
that is a gross exaggeration of what the difficulties were 
this commission should not have to live forever in the shadow of the mistakes that caused the resignation of the commission that went before it 
while there were problems and we have to resolve them in view of enlargement for instance we sometimes take the negative side too far 
mr president i should very much like to thank the rapporteur for his splendid report 
i hope that the commission will use it in its reform work 
the process of reform has been going on for some time and something like a state of emergency seems to prevail in the commission 
naturally there are good capable employees in the commission and they are in the majority 
but we need radical reform 
there is too little action and too much unnecessary bureaucracy 
people should have clearly-defined powers to take decisions for which they should also be accountable 
the financial regulation should be amended 
we agree that we should have better control of the finances 
it is just a question of how 
the commission and the committee of independent experts are in favour of completely doing away with ex ante financial control 
we should be careful about this 
we should retain some form of ex ante financial control 
it is not enough simply to carry out spot checks once the money has been spent 
this would allow too many anomalous projects to slip through 
instead we should be reforming and decentralising control 
the commission does not have enough staff 
and the commission should be able to refuse new tasks if it does not also get the extra staff it needs 
the staffing system is too rigid 
there should be a more frequent rotation of employees especially at the top of the hierarchy 
it should also be much easier to sack inefficient and incompetent employees 
i am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed 
after all the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms 
mr president commissioners first of all i cannot help but reflect upon the fact that this is on the whole a dutch-british-scandinavian debate where the speakers are concerned 
perhaps this is a little worrying 
i hope like so many others that the state of emergency in relations between the commission and parliament is on the way to being resolved 
we must get away from the idea that we are rushing to put out a fire in one corner only then to have to rush again to put out the next one 
as mr blak said we must instead establish a system with clear roles 
first of all we need tough regulations which can be implemented 
codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough 
there need to be tough rules stating among other things what may be decentralised what may be outsourced and what is independent 
i find it a little worrying that people are clamouring for independence in this debate without defining what it is in relation to which there is to be independence and without defining what right of decision-making is to be exercised 
what we need then are basic administrative regulations for the eu for its institutions and for the eu in its relations with the member states 
these are what are missing 
the van hulten report is a step in the right direction but it is not enough 
secondly we must also clarify our own auditing roles 
the court of auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action 
it is the european parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation 
we do not hunt down criminals 
tell me what national parliament for example is handed all preliminary investigation documents 
obstinate as i am i also want to say that the regulations governing public access to official records must be clearly better than the draft which has been circulating on the internet 
otherwise we shall not get anywhere in this fight 
mr president i would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report 
i am pleased that i can address him now in dutch now that mr van den berg has just done so 
otherwise i probably would have felt slightly guilty about this 
i would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement also with its amendments 
i am from the social committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic 
i think that this is also the case here but i think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these amendments 
i would also point out that our coordinator on the budgetary control committee is mr pomés ruiz who is spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a spanish perspective 
a very important proposal indeed 
i am only very surprised that the socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by mrs morgan because she wants to scrap it altogether 
i cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale 
on the one hand we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but at the same time mrs morgan wants to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well as a result of which in fact the entire content of this report vanishes 
i do not know whether this is to appease mr kinnock but i happen to know mr kinnock 
he is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary 
in my opinion such a far-reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary 
finally the issue of officials 
i do agree that the section on officials has in fact been completed totally inadequately 
first of all the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised 
secondly all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement 
for example we are currently looking into taos 
this is a key point but at the same time we want to abolish temporary staff at the commission 
these two considerations are diametrically opposed to each other and i really fail to grasp how such a proposal can end up on the table 
our parliament first asked experts to help it evaluate the performance of the european commission and they took advantage of this invitation to determine themselves what its future should be 
in this second report the experts have gone a step further and criticised some of the political groups in parliament which may have hesitated to remove the european commission from office since they shared the political affiliations of some of its members 
the experts think that this problem will be resolved by banning the commissioners from belonging to political groups 
according to the experts parliament should no longer have the power to supervise the european commission 
this task should be taken over by a committee which will guarantee high standards in public life and this should be a standing committee not elected presumably made up of another group of experts 
in this their second report the experts tell us that italy is financed by the cohesion fund that the erdf and the social fund represent two-thirds of the structural funds and that the principles of additionality and complementarity in the structural funds come to the same thing 
they tell us that the farming lobby is forcing us to finance rural development through the eaggf-guarantee and that the principle of partnership only applies to the commission and to the member states 
this lesson in wisdom is % ideology and % knowledge 
this will not help us to reform the european institutions whilst fully respecting democratic institutions 
the van hulten report started out as a brilliant one and i would like to pay deep and sincere tribute here to what mr van hulten achieved 
unfortunately it was then changed and changed for the worse which turned it into a document which in fact proposes something that we cannot accept 
mr president mr van hulten your work is worthy of being qualified as enterprising arduous and complex and i believe this is important in a first report 
please therefore accept what i am about to say as being criticism made in the spirit of honest debate and i believe that in this way our debate here today will be richer 
this report seems to me to be redundant long-winded confused and lacking in accuracy in the terms used 
it is the responsibility of this parliament 
that is to say if this parliament commissions a committee of experts and i am not going to repeat what mr casaca has said but i agree with him to a large extent to analyse a problem where is the sense in indulging in the medieval tradition of criticising the critics and so on ad infinitum 
clearly we are awaiting this reform from the commission we are awaiting the proposals which the commission is going to make to us and this parliament will have to express its opinion on them 
meanwhile we have to offer the commission a vote of confidence 
'long-winded' 
i am not going to mention the length of this report 
i do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here but for this type of resolution it certainly does 
i do not believe that there has ever been a resolution and in this parliament we certainly produce complex resolutions which has had paragraphs of more than lines without a single full stop 
i am not going to return to what has been said about the analysis of questions concerning parliament 
that should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue but not in this report 
and finally mr president frankly i am not going to give examples but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy 
therefore in summary i await and many of us await your report commissioner kinnock so that we can really express our opinion on it which is the duty of this parliament 
mr president the scope and highly detailed nature of the proposals for necessary reform measures show just how important these reforms are 
when one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them 
hopes and expectations were raised higher still by the strong messages sent out by commissioners prodi and kinnock in plenary and in the committee on budgetary control 
the concept of transparency stands out in the report 
securing this is a major priority 
the importance of smooth-running comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough 
this is not just about bureaucratic reform however rather it is about showing good will towards the citizens 
we must win back their faith in eu politics 
the citizens demand rapid and open access to the institutions and call for eu provisions to be comprehensible to them 
this is what enables them to understand what is going on 
however it annoyed me when i heard today that the commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the interim report with parliament on an informal basis 
however mr kinnock your presentation to the committee on budgetary control this coming tuesday must not just be a one-way street rather as parliamentarians we want and must play a part in this and it also goes against my understanding of politics when i find that yet another press conference has taken place this week before we have had chance to carefully discuss the submission in the competent committee on budgetary control 
i believe mr kinnock that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level the commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations 
can i begin by stating for the record and for the enlightenment of mrs langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the commission's it was the decision of this parliament 
so if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this house 
she knows me well enough to understand that at all stages in the five years in which we worked together in this house there has never been a single occasion on which i have refused to account in full formally and in detail for everything i have done 
mr president may i begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and from what i hear the pains-accepting work of mr van hulten in preparing his report 
although new to this house he is relatively old in some respects certainly in his familiarity with the institutions as a former official and i think that the value of that is shown by his ability to tackle the complex subject which is of critical importance as several members have said to all of our institutions 
i thank him and i wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative 
mr president as you will know mr van hulten's report on the second report of the committee of independent experts is necessarily long and since i want to make a comprehensive reply particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control i seek your indulgence 
naturally i will not take up any more of the time of the house than is absolutely necessary 
when this house considered the second report of the committee of experts last september i pledged on behalf of the incoming commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the commission's reform proposals 
our efforts to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the house when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the commission today well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago 
i am sure that mr pomes ruiz is encouraged by that 
the great majority of the paper's proposals are closely akin to those put by mr van hulten and that paper includes i say to him and to mr staes a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform 
there is nothing therefore that is open-ended or vague about the report which i have had the honour to compile 
the considered view of this parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance 
i would say to mr elles that we are most definitely in listening mode 
but he will appreciate with his customary generosity i am sure that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing 
hence the transmission 
though time forbids me mr president from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the house i readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas 
turning to the main themes of the resolution i offer the following observations 
the need for transparency is rightly stressed not least because greater transparency in the way in which the commission operates will improve the efficiency and will also demystify what the commission does 
this is essential for an executive administration that must be accountable not just to this house but more generally to the european public 
naturally sensible safeguards are required to protect specially sensitive information but the cases where these are needed should be kept to the minimum possible 
i have repeatedly emphasised that indeed not just as a commissioner but in or years of campaigning 
that most certainly is the intention of the commission 
financial management and control is obviously a crucial area of reform 
as the house knows and has repeatedly said the scale and scope of the union's financial interventions have grown immensely in the past decade without a proportionate increase in staffing or an adjustment in procedures 
several members have made that point again in the course of today's debate 
we share the view forcefully expressed by the committee of independent experts and repeated in this draft resolution that the time has come for a thorough overhaul of our rules and procedures 
the means of doing that are set out in the reform strategy and the commission will present its proposals for a radical recasting of the financial regulation in april 
parliamentary support in pursuing that essential course for change will be absolutely vital 
i share the view expressed by mrs theato that it would not be acceptable in any way at all for us to seek to operate new arrangements without a change in the law 
change in the law is fundamental 
there are preparations which can be made and they are specified and set out with the full reassurances in the reform strategy but enactment of change in the legislation is obviously of fundamental importance to the operation of the new system 
essentially and with legal change the commission will systematically move away from the current centralised system of prior approval of each financial transaction by the financial controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems within spending departments so that directors-general are better equipped to take responsibility for decisions with an impact on the european union budget 
in addition and to achieve better assurances than those provided under the present system the new system of decentralised controls must be complemented by setting up an internal audit service the second key as herr bösch said established in a way that is closely consistent with the recommendations of the committee of experts 
that service will open on may this year 
it will be headed by a professionally qualified member of the audit profession and its independence must and will be guaranteed through a new provision to be added in the financial regulation 
the new service will report to me and it will be accompanied by an audit progress board chaired by my colleague mrs schreyer who i am delighted to see in the chamber this evening 
as budgets commissioner here responsibilities already include relations with the court of auditors 
this audit progress board will ensure effective and rigorous follow-up to internal audits 
i want to emphasise strongly that changing our control systems will definitely not mean relaxing them 
the proposed change will make the systems more effective both in terms of inputs and in terms of measured and accountable outcomes 
i can also specifically assure the house that we are not going for what is sometimes called a big bang approach 
i am somewhat surprised that paragraph of the draft resolution does not appear to address the fundamental criticisms of the current centralised financial control function made in both reports of the committee of independent experts 
that committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralised ex ante visa 
it was clear too on the need to separate internal audit from financial control 
in addition i do not believe that paragraph fully reflects the opinion of the court of auditors in 
the commission's internal control he said is not forceful enough in preventing incorrect operation 
for instance the financial controller granted a positive a priori visa in most of the cases of mismanagement or irregularities recently uncovered 
at the same time the internal audit function is carried out in an uncoordinated way by several bodies notably the same financial controller the inspectorate general and by some units operating directorates-general 
the centralised ex ante approval system was doubtlessly originally designed to ensure carefulness but over the years it has had the perverse effect of reducing the extent to which managers feel responsible for their decisions 
i do not believe that there is any real disagreement between us on this 
i take it from paragraph that the underlying preoccupation of honourable members is that there should be a carefully managed transition 
that will most certainly be the character of the change as honourable members will see when they read the reform strategy document 
before leaving this area i would add that we agree with the rapporteur that the existing internal audit function must be maintained pending the establishment of the new independent internal audit service in a matter of months 
turning quickly to the section of the resolution on fighting fraud corruption mismanagement and nepotism the major new proposal of the report concerns reporting by commission officials of perceived wrong-doing 
as i made clear in the hearings last september and on other occasions we are at one in the belief that there is value in defining the best possible mechanisms for this purpose although obviously we all hope that it will rarely be needed 
since june of last year the olaf regulation has given better guidance to staff about reporting possible irregularities 
we propose to complement those provisions by defining the rights and obligations for officials to report suspected wrong-doing through internal channels but not exclusively within the same hierarchical line 
the possibility of using specified external channels will also be addressed 
we are seeking to implement best practice 
serious response to reports confidentiality at early stages and career protection will be assured for people who report wrong-doing in good faith and in ways that do not compromise investigations by untimely disclosure 
as a corollary there will be safeguards for officials who are the subject of false allegations 
a communication later this year will give full details 
i do not think parliament will be disappointed by what we will propose 
i am persuaded however by the suggestion in paragraph of the report on using external bodies to enforce existing provisions on financial liability 
we already plan to reform the existing disciplinary procedures to ensure thoroughness fairness consistency and professionalism 
and we will propose the establishment of an interinstitutional disciplinary board something else on which we will need the support and understanding of parliament 
a communication in june will set out the full proposal for change 
standards in public life is the next main section of the report before the house 
with the introduction of a series of codes of conduct the current commission has begun to develop an explicit ethical framework 
this will be taken a step further with a proposal in june for an interinstitutional agreement on a committee on standards in public life 
that is in line with the draft resolution 
an important role for the committee will be to give advice on ethics and standards and to supervise common and separate codes of conduct for the institutions 
i welcome parliament's support for that 
we are also currently examining how we can most effectively implement the proposal for a classification system for documents made in paragraph of mr van hulten's report 
the draft resolution rightly recalls the commission's accountability to this parliament 
president prodi and vice-president de palacio and other colleagues have demonstrated the commission's practical commitment to that 
i hope that we will soon be able to agree a code of conduct on relations between our institutions which will include updated rules on access to documents 
the point was very properly raised by mr elles and referred to by mrs thors 
i am sure they are aware that in mid-december we officially received the draft framework agreement with parliament 
we are now waiting for parliament to decide when it wishes to begin negotiations on the text 
we are very happy to proceed as rapidly as possible 
the report rightly emphasises the central importance that human resources policy must have in reform 
i am glad to say to mr van hulten and mr haarder that the detailed recommendations on recruitment training appraisal and the appointment to management positions are very much in line with our own thinking and our own proposals 
i also want to move towards a linear career system because the current category system is no longer adapted to the needs of our institutions 
it certainly blocks the advance and mobility of people with proven capabilities 
members who in the course of this debate have properly praised commission officials who in the great majority and typically are of high integrity hard-working and of great capability are absolutely right in the comments that they have made 
while the reform strategy white paper will clearly outline our ideas on these and other points detail and precision are obviously essential 
a series of communications will therefore follow in the coming months 
each of them will be available for reflection and response by this house 
it is meanwhile very obvious that we will need to work closely with parliament as an institution on central matters of common interest notably pay and pensions and the revision of the staff regulations 
on this latter point we are reflecting on whether it might be useful to adopt a framework regulation which makes common provision on leading issues like pay conditions staff representation rights and so on but enables the different institutions to operate implementing rules on other matters 
the early thoughts of parliament on this consultative idea would be especially welcome 
i conclude by referring to paragraph of the resolution before the house relating to the resource requirements of our policies for change 
that is most certainly relevant 
we are sure that there will be an important reform dividend as the modernisation measures begin to foster increased efficiency and better management in the use of resources 
it is very clear however that parts of the commission services are already very stretched 
parliament has frequently made that point 
secondly it is also clear that reform will require some new investment in training for skills and in technology 
thirdly it is very clear that increased preparations for enlargement must be undertaken 
they are already having implications for resource availability 
it is also clear that if we take on new tasks which we will surely be asked to do by the council and parliament we will have to identify so-called negative priorities and drop those negative priorities in order to create spare capacity 
a central feature of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous process for tying the process of priority-setting into resource allocation under a system of activity-based management 
i want to emphasise however that whilst internal discipline on priority-setting will certainly be introduced by the commission it can only be fully effective if parliament and the council share it and take an equally stringent attitude to the demands made on the commission 
the commission therefore welcomes paragraph of mr van hulten's report 
i conclude mr president by thanking the house for its attention during an unavoidably lengthy speech and by expressing sincere gratitude to the rapporteur to the committee on budgetary control and to the other committees which gave their opinions 
we look forward to working closely with this house on the finalisation of the reform strategy package and then most important of all working together with this house on its implementation continually through the years that will be required on such complexities 
the debate is closed 
the vote will take place tomorrow at p.m 
the next item is the continuation of the council and commission statements on the middle east peace process 
my only regret is that my own commitment to open the european reconstruction agency on monday meant that i could not take part myself in that trip to the middle east even though as i mentioned earlier in the day which is another story events conspired to maroon me at munich airport rather than transport me to thessaloniki 
such is life 
i hope that honourable members will excuse me if i am not able to stay to the end of the debate as i would in all normal circumstances wish to do 
the debate was fixed for this morning and on that basis i had arranged to see visitors from the balkans this evening 
so i hope i can count on the understanding of the house on this occasion 
it is not something i assure you which i would wish to make a practice of 
there is reasonable hope that a basis for a peace agreement can be built in the near future 
at the same time we must not lose sight of the palestinian track 
the situation of the palestinians has always been the core issue of the conflict 
a fair and indeed generous deal with them remains the key to lasting peace in the middle east 
israelis and palestinians have made substantial progress in implementing the sharm el-sheikh memorandum 
although there has been some slippage i trust that the remaining israeli troop redeployments will materialise soon 
similarly despite the indication the day before yesterday that the timetable for the framework agreement on permanent status has been pushed beyond the mid-february deadline i very much hope that the much more important september deadline for the final agreement on permanent status will be reached 
i was reassured that this was also the view of prime minister barak and president arafat when they met on monday 
honourable members will know that one particular concern of ours has been that there should be a resumption of progress on the multilateral track 
this is far from straightforward but we will do what we can to make this possible in close liaison with the us and russian co-sponsors as well as the regional parties 
we are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development 
the beginning of the talks with syria paved the way for a convening of the multilateral steering group in moscow at the end of the month 
i look forward to attending that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push things forward again 
the european union has an important role to play in the peace process as all sides palestinians israelis their arab neighbours and the united states have acknowledged 
nor is our role confined to that of banker 
we must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region 
but we should not kid ourselves a comprehensive middle east peace deal comes with a hefty price tag 
the commission is already considering the implications for the european union of the recent encouraging developments 
we intend to share our more detailed thoughts on the matter with parliament and council soon 
but let me remind honourable members that the european union is no slouch when it comes to financial support for the peace process 
we are the largest of all donors to the palestinians 
we have also offered very substantial support to jordan lebanon syria and egypt 
with the israelis we have established closer cooperation in a number of areas of particular interest to them 
the community contribution of over eur million in grants and loans between and effectively underpinned the palestinian authority and contributed substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorated physical infrastructure in the west bank and gaza 
european union member states together contributed another eur million during that crucial period 
in this context let me applaud the important steps that the palestinian authority has recently taken to improve budgetary transparency 
president arafat will be meeting the council of ministers next week 
this will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous steps to improve the palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law 
the commission is actively involved in those efforts 
the commission has also stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between israelis and arabs 
we committed more than eur million for such projects last year 
this package included renewed assistance for people-to-people activities and cross-border cooperation where israelis and arabs meet on non-governmental and expert levels 
members will recall that the european union is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the middle east 
a number of issues naturally emerge as additional potential targets of community support in the coming phase of the peace process among them helping to consolidate a golan settlement both in terms of contributing to security arrangements and supporting demining and the rebuilding of communities in the golan heights 
syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a wartime to a peace economy 
reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern lebanon the only middle eastern area with an ongoing military conflict will also demand considerable efforts 
we also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in lebanon as a whole 
a solution is needed to the palestinian refugee problem these are the largest group of refugees in the world numbering nearly million people an indication of the enormous challenges ahead 
we must support initiatives increasing the availability and improving the distribution and management of the region's very scarce water resources 
lastly but maybe most importantly we are encouraging closer regional cooperation in a number of areas bringing all the countries concerned together in a joint endeavour to address their common problems 
it is already apparent that the financial resources currently available for community assistance to this part of the world will not be sufficient for the magnitude of support that will be required in the event of permanent peace 
i want to underline that point 
i wish insistently to remind the council and should it be necessary parliament that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing 
i repeat that a change in the politics of the middle east will require a gear change in the support that we shall be asked and expected to provide 
i hope i can add that we will want to provide that 
we have made progress in recent months and weeks as mr gama mentioned earlier 
but it is inevitably going to be a tough process with difficulties and disappointments on the way 
we will do all we can to help the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligations and challenges that will be created by that outcome 
lastly i will repeat for some who have entered the chamber in the last few minutes what i said at the outset of my remarks that i will not be able to stay until the end of the debate largely as a result of having assumed that the debate was taking place this morning and having fixed a meeting on the balkans for this evening 
i hope the house will understand that 
mr president commissioner patten has our understanding 
i would like to tell him that communications with madrid are usually more fluid and therefore i hope to see him there soon 
the statements we have heard today on the middle east peace process are very opportune at the moment because of the hurried tour which minister gama whose absence from this debate i also regret has made of the region accompanied by other council representatives 
the tone of the news in the media on the recent events in the area could lead us to take a pessimistic view of the situation 
i honestly believe that an evaluation of this type would not be in accordance with the reality of that situation 
let me explain it is true that the israeli government has delayed the third hand-over of west bank territory to the palestinian authorities 
it is also true however that since the signing of the sharm el-sheikh agreements % of the territory of the west bank has been handed over to the palestinian national authority together with two thirds of the gaza strip and more importantly this agreement has so far been scrupulously complied with since under the terms laid down in sharm el-sheikh the israeli government has the right to delay that handover 
this is naturally on the condition that the delay does not exceed three weeks as prime minister barak has promised 
on the other hand the decision to delay the second round of talks initiated in shepherdstown by the syrian arab republic is undoubtedly significant but i am convinced that the hopes which were raised on january in that town will not be dashed 
mr president the fact that the different groups in this parliament are tabling a motion for a resolution in this ever controversial debate which is the result of a broad consensus seems to me to demonstrate the clear political will to decisively support open peace processes 
i would therefore like equally firmly to express our rejection of the use of violence to resolve differences which are still no doubt profound between the parties 
in my judgement this constitutes a guarantee to both sides both from a political and a financial point of view of the commitment they can expect from the european union in terms of its contribution to the cost of the peace which we all long for 
it is clear to everyone that this is essential to guaranteeing security in the area and to cooperating in the development which is needed to heal the serious social differences which exist 
but this also serves to make a claim on the part of the european union for a degree of political participation in the process which is consistent with its economic contribution we do not have aspirations to be bankers and which will be suitably visible to the public 
there is absolutely no doubt that the forthcoming trip by the president of the european parliament to the region will contribute to this 
mr president i want to thank commissioner patten for his detailed account 
we in parliament strongly support the middle east peace process 
it is of course a peace process which is finally under way 
if we think of how the process was looking a year ago the difference between then and now is like that between night and day despite difficulties and delays 
i want to emphasise four points 
this applies both to the interim agreement and to the hebron and wye agreements 
while the negotiations on the final peace settlement have begun i think it is important to keep the two processes apart 
a lack of progress in the final status negotiations should not jeopardise implementation of the three above-mentioned interim agreements 
what we need to look out for in this context is how matters develop in connection with the harbours in gaza the northern transit route between gaza and the west bank further releases of political prisoners and implementation of the financial commitments 
the second point relates to syria 
there the border question is obviously central 
how negotiations are proceeding there we still do not know 
what is important however is that they have begun 
an important question in this context is the future distribution of water 
as things are at present the golan heights account for between a third and a sixth of israel's water supply 
the third aspect is the peace negotiations in syria which are closely linked to the issue of israeli withdrawal from southern lebanon 
according to unifil there are now concrete signs that israel is preparing to withdraw which is something we welcome 
there too of course outstanding matters in dispute are the water problem and the situation of the lebanese palestinian refugees 
my last point concerns the future palestinian state 
the barak government has given to understand that it intends to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party 
even if negotiations are not completed by september of this year there is nothing in the relevant treaties to prevent a palestinian state from being proclaimed after that date 
in this context it is important for those of us who support the idea of a palestinian state that the latter should be as commissioner patten said namely a state subject to public control and that it should be a democratic state 
this is something to which we all want to contribute 
mr president i would like to refer firstly and above all to the joint resolution which will be laid down to round off this debate 
my group has made a contribution to this resolution and needless to say approves of it 
more specifically however i would like to express our delight at the fact that after such a long time israel and syria are on speaking terms again to resolve their differences of opinion 
the recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the middle east 
it is therefore regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being 
indeed both parties will need to make huge efforts 
it is also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relations and to establish constant dialogue 
in addition to the bilateral meetings with syria i hope that israel will also enter into negotiations with lebanon within the foreseeable future and that in the framework of economic and regional cooperation a multilateral approach will appear possible 
nevertheless it is still regrettable that the european union one of the most important financial donors is still unable to play a major political role in the peace process 
this is where mr solana the high representative to the council could come into his own 
the commission and member states also have to be encouraged to support projects which can help develop understanding and partnership between the different nations in the region 
i should also draw your attention to the significance of the barcelona process which should have a beneficial impact on regional cooperation 
there are still needless to say many unresolved problems and unanswered questions also involving the palestinians 
everyone knows that the peace process is a protracted and difficult affair but we are convinced that with the necessary trust perseverance and indispensable political will our common goal namely a peaceful and prosperous middle east will be achieved 
mr president it is pleasing that despite certain delays and problems the peace negotiations are going on both between israel and palestine and between israel and syria 
the moment of truth is approaching 
will israel let palestinian refugees return or be given compensation 
will israel share jerusalem and the water of the river jordan 
will a free palestine be a truly democratic state and therefore reliable as a partner in peace 
the fact that the main responsibility for the peace process lies with the occupying country israel does not prevent the arab partners from also having a considerable share of the responsibility 
peace in the middle east concerns us all however 
it is therefore good that the eu should act as a godparent to the palestinian state 
this has been interpreted as indicating that the arab attitude towards israel should be regarded by europeans as being similar to the nazis' anti-semitism which of course is completely incorrect 
but today egypt jordan and palestine have peace treaties with israel 
i therefore wonder whether commissioner patten does not agree with me that it would have been only right and proper to have invited at least one arab state to the holocaust conference in stockholm 
mr president i would like to thank commissioner patten very much for the awareness he has demonstrated of the difficulties inherent in the peace process and the challenge that the european union is taking on to bring it to completion 
it is high time there was peace in the middle east 
it is time to end the era which began with the balfour declaration in and the arab-israeli war of 
it is time there were secure borders and political social and economic rights in every country in this region and that human rights were recognised and upheld in syria palestine israel and everywhere else 
this is an exercise in sovereignty and in democracy for each population and every individual but to this end it is vital for all parties in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and rights and to recognise the other as its partner and not as its subject to whom concessions must be given 
i refer principally to the palestine-israel question but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the golan since and in southern lebanon since 
israel has to accept its responsibilities withdraw from the occupied territories and share its water resources but at the same time it has to be sure that it will be safe and able to live in peace in terms of economic and political relations with all the countries in the area 
however israel is not the only country concerned with security 
the same goes for the other countries especially for the palestinians who are still living under military occupation and whose land even today is still confiscated in areas b and c despite the oslo agreement and subsequent agreements 
trees have been uprooted houses are still being demolished and above all water supplies have been reduced or refused especially in east jerusalem while the settlements continue and are growing constantly 
nevertheless there is no doubt that with the election of the new government positive steps have been taken negotiations at least have resumed 
but in the middle east there can be no stable and lasting peace if the palestinians do not have their own state if they cannot move freely within their own territory 
all the international community has to do is implement resolutions and 
we feel it is extremely important for the european union to play a political role in negotiations which matches its economic aid 
we cannot be content with a role backstage 
we must be leading protagonists while staying off a collision course with the united states as minister gama said 
mr president firstly my thanks and appreciation to commissioner patten for his comments here today particularly in relation to the role of the european union in the peace process and for reaffirming that our role is not only that of banker for the entire operation 
i was deeply disappointed at the news this week that the peace talks between israel and syria had been suspended 
i very much hope that a compromise can be reached to overcome this so that the peace negotiations can be resumed at a very early date 
nevertheless we cannot deny that some positive political progress has been made in the middle east of late 
the fact that the syrian foreign minister and the israeli prime minister were recently sitting around the same table in america for the first time in their respective histories is an indication that old hatreds and animosities can be overcome 
political leaders must show real courage to put in place a framework which can lead to an overall peace settlement within the middle east 
i know that if agreement can be reached between syria and israel the israeli prime minister will still face real opposition to any new agreement with syria in any future referendum 
the settlers at the golan heights will demand to be compensated and there will have to be guarantees of security 
on the issue of palestine i recognise that there are still some difficulties with regard to the implementation of some aspects of the wye agreement 
the key problem areas at the moment include the difficulties of redeployment as well as the transfer of territories 
the low level of releases of palestinian prisoners and the fact that the israeli government appears to intend halting implementation of building permits already granted as well as not approving new ones pose further obstacles 
these issues have clearly been holding up progress on the permanent status negotiations although i believe these talks will not be held up indefinitely 
at present the main difficulty in approaching the negotiations seems to be that the palestinians are insisting that the border issue must be agreed upon first while the israeli government says that it should be settled only if a solution is reached on the issue of settlements and security 
currently both sides seem to have accepted that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed 
in conclusion while other countries in the middle east have had reservations about the overall direction of the peace process now that the syrian government has been brought into the peace process egypt and other countries in the region are willing to move forward 
i sincerely hope that in the interests of improving the safety and quality of life of the people living in the middle east all the key protagonists will move forward quickly in the very near future so as to reach an overall agreement on all the key matters which need to be resolved 
mr president the various motions for resolutions tabled in parliament more or less represent the situation in the middle east 
there are those who are in favour of new agreements between israel and syria but only a few focus on the real problem at the heart of the middle east issue 
indeed the time has come to resolve a central problem for global stability 
the time has come for israel to fulfil its promises of old and definitively withdraw from the occupied territories at last recognising once and for all the authority of palestine whose resumed diplomatic activity will have a secure future while it is under the wise leadership of yasser arafat 
it is equally important not to lose sight of the iraq question which no one discusses anymore thereby relegating the problems of millions of women elderly people and children the victims of an embargo as arrogant as it is wicked to oblivion 
i do not know what syria and israel will want or be able to do in reality but i do know that our institution can do a lot and it is time that it attached the same importance to peoples' lives as it does to the ballasts of the cold colourless artificial neon bulbs in our lamps which can illuminate houses but not the world in the third millennium 
mr president the israeli author amos oz managed to capture very aptly the icy atmosphere at the negotiating table between the israelis and syrians recently 
he was under the impression that the syrians thought that in exchange for the golan heights all they had to do was to fax the israelis a receipt 
and the israelis were certainly not impressed by the discourteous behaviour of minister farouk al-shara in shepherdstown 
his behaviour towards prime minister ehud barak was plainly insulting 
but why pay attention to such detail as basic diplomatic niceties in the face of a tough negotiation process over territory 
well the syrians are quite possibly cutting off their nose to spite their face 
at the end of the day israeli voters can still express an opinion on the return of the golan 
all the resolutions submitted express the sincere wish for greater european involvement in the peace process 
it is however very much in doubt whether brussels can make available the billions of dollars which the israeli and syrian authorities require from their peace patron the united states not to mention the heavy equally costly security guarantees in case of an israeli withdrawal from the golan 
i would like to finish off by asking the european council and commission a question 
how accurate are the press reports which state that the portuguese presidency has already pledged troops as a peacekeeping force in the golan 
mr president the truth is that the news of the indefinite suspension or delay of the talks between syria and israel is not good news but nor is it good news that the day before yesterday there was another bomb attack which injured people 
it is clear that for once the united states has not been able to secure progress on the restarting of these negotiations and it is true that the obstacles are difficult to overcome the syrians wish to regain sovereignty and jurisdiction over the golan heights and re-establish the borders which existed before june while the israelis wish since they consider that it suits their situation better to have the borders which were set in 
the suspension of the talks between syria and israel is not the only delay affecting the peace process in the middle east 
the application of the framework agreement between the palestinian authorities and israel is also suspended at the moment 
after the talks which took place the day before yesterday between the israeli prime minister and the leader of the palestinian authority the israeli prime minister requested a delay of two months as from february the deadline for the implementation of the framework agreement on the situation in the west bank and the gaza strip 
what can the european union do in these circumstances 
unfortunately very little 
it naturally has to support these negotiations sponsored by the united states contacts have to be increased the presence of the european union envoy ambassador moratinos who has fulfilled his mission with great diligence and efficiency within the powers of the european union is positive 
but none of this hides the fact that there is a certain sense of impotence because when the negotiators from each side fly back to the united states this weekend we will have to remember that for every dollars spent on the peace process in the region are contributed by the european union 
i would like to insist to the portuguese presidency that we must play a greater role that it is time to take over and to secure greater participation for the european union in this process 
i hope that the forthcoming visit by the president of the european parliament to the region as well as the presidents of the relevant interparliamentary delegations will begin an era of greater initiative and a greater presence for the european union in this complicated and difficult peace process 
mr president mr president-in-office of the council commissioner patten i should like to thank you for your statements especially commissioner patten whose analysis i fully share and i shall not therefore repeat any of his ideas 
i should just like to make three comments which commissioner patten will perhaps see as similar but which for various reasons a member can formulate more openly 
first i believe that we can welcome the agreement between israel and the palestinian authorities 
but we have enough agreements now oslo wye plantation sharm el-sheikh 
we have enough agreements they just need to be implemented 
my second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between syria and israel 
i consider this to be very encouraging news 
but we have also learned this week that mr barak will not be travelling to washington and that the negotiations cannot therefore be continued 
i should like to make it quite clear if the golan heights are returned to syria the problem in this region will be solved 
on the question of the referendum which various members have referred to we must consider if a referendum always needs to be held in order to honour obligations under international law and under the law of nations 
in germany there would probably be dancing in the streets if we were to say that we were holding a referendum on payments to the european union and we shall pay if the german people are prepared to pay 
that would be a similar situation 
my third and last point concerns the role of the european union 
i should really like to stress the excellent role which mr moratinos' special mission has played in the region and the funding which we have provided there commissioner patten 
you know that you will always have our support here in parliament and that includes your proposal and we shall be behind you when the time comes to finance it 
but we must also play a political role and mr moratinos cannot play that role in this region on his own the presidency of the council must take action the eu high representative for common foreign and security policy must travel to the region and we must do as the russians did and invite the protagonists of the peace process ourselves 
then we will have played the role which is commensurate with our participation and our contribution 
mr president commissioner patten the recent peace talks begun in the usa between israel and syria mark a turning point in the history of the middle east 
it has taken fifty years to reach this point which will involve some particularly difficult negotiations 
there will be no meeting today in shepherdstown but we must hope as mr patten said just now that this postponement of the negotiations due to syrian requirements will only represent one more step on the road to a peace agreement which will change the face of the middle east 
this hope is contained in our motion for a resolution 
we hope for a fair and balanced agreement based on respect for sovereignties and the right to live securely within safe and recognised borders 
all the foreign troops including therefore the syrian forces must withdraw from lebanon in accordance with resolution of the united nations security council 
dare we hope for an israeli withdrawal from south lebanon by july the date promised by ehud barak 
dare we hope for a dual peace agreement between israel and its neighbours to the north 
we really hope and believe so 
never have the parties been so determined 
one fundamental point to be stressed is the balance which must be expressed in the message from europe and which must exist between the people 
there must also be a political balance between the participants in the negotiations 
following the attack in hadera on monday we must repeat our condemnation of any form of terrorism 
in terms of balance or should i say imbalance i must add that it is to be regretted that europe is still playing a minor political role in resolving this conflict 
at midday mr gama referred to the financial and commercial support provided by europe to the region 
despite everything we are being forced to recognise that the resumption of the peace process is largely due to the work of washington 
like other arab countries before them the syrians chose the americans to sponsor the negotiations 
this was the choice also made by israel where europe suffers from a partisan public image and this is a fact not a judgement 
this is now the opportunity to reiterate to mr patten mr solana and mr moratinos how much we are relying on their efforts to include europe in the search for a peaceful solution to the conflict 
although it is difficult for europe to speak with one voice about the peace process it can and must speak in the same spirit of confidence and solidarity 
mr president was the year of the entry into force of the treaty of amsterdam of the communitisation of the schengen agreement and of the extraordinary tampere council 
the council has decided to draw up a charter of citizens' rights and we rejoice in this it has decided to implement article of the treaty combating all forms of discrimination and xenophobia and it has decided to approximate the laws on conditions for admission and residence as well as guaranteeing residents treatment which is fair and on an equal footing with the citizens of the union 
it has also reached a political agreement and we congratulate them on this on the initial proposals for civil cooperation 
this has been the year in which policies on justice and home affairs have been provided with a community framework 
they have been put into the hands of a single commissioner mr antonio vitorino and we congratulate them on this as well 
furthermore they have taken on the task of creating a scoreboard to verify the progress made in this area at community level but also and this seems to me to be important at the level of the member states 
we are pleased about this and we congratulate the council on these decisions despite the fact that for this house the treaty of amsterdam included one disappointment that of delaying for five years our role our ability to participate actively to democratically control this area of freedom security and justice as well as the role taken in it by the court of justice 
however if on verifying the progress made during which is within the competence of this parliament in accordance with the treaty we leave behind the stage of great declarations and look at the decisions actually taken and carried out the scene looks considerably darker mr president 
it is as if the council had more than one face and two hands and what one signs up to the other begrudges 
despite all the commitments made at the highest level the council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged 
programmes multiply and overlap and there is no way of ascertaining levels of implementation and effectiveness or at least this parliament is unable to do so 
we have presented the council with a series of questions and i know that it is the will of the portuguese presidency to answer each and every one of them 
we hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the council towards this parliament 
i said that there was no consistency between the decisions taken by the council and the policies actually carried out 
there are doubts in my group and doubts also persist in this house for example about something which should be good news the incorporation of the schengen agreement into the community framework 
schengen has been incorporated as we said earlier into the acquis but it has been done with very little transparency 
not a single piece of information nor a single consultation has been addressed to parliament during this process neither on the association of the united kingdom nor on the incorporation of greece nor on the negotiations with norway and iceland 
the same is true with regard to immigration policy 
we have amused ourselves with a pile of reports but we have no idea what has happened to these initiatives they have disappeared 
we hope that will be the year for action in the same way that was the year for expectations 
we hope that the council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this parliament 
the council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the union 
if it chooses the second approach it must be aware that this presents risks and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom security and justice is built 
alternatively it could accept the offer of an agreement amongst the institutions in order to move forward in another way 
fulfil your obligations to parliament in a generous spirit thus preparing for the future 
provide the commission with the necessary resources and recognition essential for it to carry out its work and for it to verify the real progress made at community level and at the level of the member states and we will be and the council will be able to deal with the decisions made at tampere and move towards a union which is freer more just and more secure 
madam president commissioner ladies and gentlemen it is rather moving for me to return to this house in my capacity as a member of the council 
i was one of the first portuguese members of this house who in took the first steps towards the integration of portugal into the european union and i have to say mr president-in-office of the council ladies and gentlemen that the experience i gained here political experience has been extremely important in my life and that the information we gained and the contribution that we were all able to make towards building europe definitely marked the years that i spent here and indeed my life 
so it is with some pride and satisfaction that i find myself here and able to meet up again with some of my colleagues from those days who are still in this house 
the point i wish to make is that the portuguese presidency to which the minister for justice who is handling the field of justice and home affairs and i myself both belong wishes to usher in a new era with this parliament and to foster the relationship between the council and parliament 
this will inevitably be influenced by my parliamentary experience in this house and of course by the parliamentary experience of that great member of our national parliament who is now the minister for justice and my colleague 
we gave an early signal when before the start of the portuguese presidency we met with the president and vice-presidents of the committee on citizens' freedoms and rights justice and home affairs in brussels 
we were able to invite the chairman of that committee mr watson and some members of the committee to come to lisbon and to present our views concerning the role of the portuguese presidency in this area to them 
and whenever the committee thinks fit and the chairman requests it i myself or my colleague the minister for justice will come to brussels to take part in the work of the meeting 
we will accordingly give the chairman of the committee on citizens' freedoms and rights justice and home affairs the provisional agendas for the council meetings in march and may to allow contact to be established beforehand on the subjects to be discussed in the council 
we will do this today 
turning to we find ourselves in the special position of taking stock of the german and finnish presidencies 
i would like to start by saying that in addition to the replies that we shall be giving here to mrs terrón i cusí who has presented a proposal on behalf of her committee we shall also be letting her have a written reply at the end of these discussions 
furthermore i would like to say that the council believes that was an important year in the field of justice and home affairs 
cooperation in the field of justice and home affairs was notable for the significant changes wrought by the treaty of amsterdam and as a consequence for the incorporation of schengen into the community framework 
the german presidency had an important task in this respect in achieving the transition from the maastricht system to the amsterdam system 
then there was the launching of europol soon after the start of the finnish presidency on july 
there was also a third notable event the tampere summit a european council devoted exclusively to justice and home affairs 
the tampere summit was marked by a new spirit and by a determination to put the area of freedom security and justice at the top of the political agenda and to keep it there 
as regards our replies to mrs terrón i cusí i shall try to respond to her questions on home affairs and my colleague will then address the points relating to justice 
as you know the schengen acquis applies in full to ten countries and in the course of work will be done with a view to reaching a decision on the acquis coming into force in denmark finland and sweden and also in iceland and norway 
the secretary-general of the council has published a collection of documents covering the entire schengen acquis pending publication in the official journal once all the translations are available 
this collection is at present available in six languages and the remaining translations are nearing completion 
another issue i wish to raise concerns programmes in the field of immigration and asylum and how they apply to the ceecs 
in march the council adopted the odysseus programme a programme of training exchanges and cooperation in the fields of policy on asylum immigration and crossing of external borders 
it applies to the fifteen member states of the union and provides for applicant countries and possibly third countries also to be associated with it 
this programme covers the period to and the reference amount for its implementation is eur million 
applicant countries can be associated with projects selected by the management committee as long as this complies with the objectives of the programme 
the financial envelope envisaged for is eur million 
under the programme the commission received applications for finance totalling eur million against a budget for of eur million 
the commission proposed support for projects of which were for eur and for amounts over eur 
with regard to the oisin programme and i am now referring to the budget year projects were adopted for seminars training exchanges of officials research and studies and operational actions 
of projects in all seven included applicant countries 
as regards sis the schengen information system i am pleased to report that the member states were very positive about its operation and use 
the increase in the number of positive results demonstrates the efficiency of the system and there is a continuing increase in the number of reports 
with a view to developing a customs information system agreement was reached with the commission on a system which will permit provisional application of the convention on the customs information system as soon as a certain number of countries have ratified this convention 
mrs terrón i cusí also mentioned an interinstitutional agreement 
i ought to comment on this final point once my colleague the minister for justice has spoken but it is obvious that what i shall say is the result of an exchange of impressions within the council and in particular between the two of us 
i referred earlier to a new relationship with the commission and with parliament with a view to achieving closer links and providing parliament with timely information on subjects to be discussed by the council 
i would now like to state before you here that we firmly intend to consult the european parliament not only in those cases stipulated by the treaty which we are obliged to do but also to inform and consult parliament whenever we believe that it is appropriate to widen this type of consultation and when in direct contact with the commission we believe that parliament should be able to present its opinion 
as regards information we will communicate with parliament on all matters which are important for establishing the area of freedom security and justice 
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen as i do not have a background as a member of the european parliament you will understand that it is even more moving for me to be here than it is for my colleague fernando gomes 
as mrs terrón i cusí said in her speech was a year of great expectations in the field of justice and home affairs an expectation realised with the coming into force of the treaty of amsterdam an expectation realised with the conclusions of the tampere council and a fundamental expectation as from this year that will be realised in the form of specific actions 
we are all aware that to this end it is essential for the council to approve as quickly as possible the scoreboard which commissioner vitorino has the remit of establishing 
turning to the specific questions that mrs terrón i cusí has put to us i shall group them into three basic areas the fight against organised crime the operation of the judicial network particularly as regards criminal matters and questions on europol 
regarding the fight against organised crime marked the implementation of several important actions stemming from the vienna action plan which resulted in the signing of the charter of european professional associations in developments in cooperation and in establishing points of contact between the member states for receiving information relevant to the fight against money laundering 
this is an area in which we must carry forward and intensify our work not just by securing approval for the eu strategy for the fight against organised crime in the new millennium but also so as to overcome the difficulties associated with the divergence of views that exists particularly at council level on issues concerning the fight against organised crime 
with this in mind i must emphasise the importance we attach to the cooperation we are already establishing with the french presidency with the aim of organising a jumbo jha-ecofin council 
if this is not to be a mere media event it will need to be carefully prepared by a joint committee the composition of which the portuguese presidency has already proposed 
our relations with third countries represent another important aspect of the fight against organised crime 
here in addition to the work being done in the group of experts on the pre-accession pact it is important that it has proved possible to draw up a joint action plan for the fight against organised crime between the european union and the russian federation a plan which is now being finalised and to organise meetings of liaison officials from the member states in moscow and to develop a set of further initiatives 
another area is eu involvement in the united nations convention against transnational organised crime and its various protocols and in the conventions being prepared in the framework of the council of europe in particular on cyber crime 
as this is an issue which has become important in the justice and home affairs programme the presidency believes that it is worthwhile bearing in mind the principles of chapter vi of the treaty to explore suitable means of providing the european parliament with improved information on the progress and conclusion of these negotiations under the united nations convention 
with regard to the judicial network significant progress has been made in particular the launch at the end of of the dedicated telecommunications system of the european judicial network whilst the multi-disciplinary group has developed a series of actions to implement the action plan 
however we must stress that it is vital for approval to be given as soon as possible to the strategy for the new millennium so as to give a fresh impetus while preserving continuity to the work done under the previous action plan 
still on judicial cooperation considerable progress has been made on the legal protection of the euro and the european parliament is being consulted on a framework decision which is of fundamental strategic importance 
we believe that if legal protection of the euro is to be credible we must avoid having a multiplicity of instruments and we should accordingly make a combined effort in march to approve a single instrument covering all necessary aspects including those featuring in initiatives already presented by france and those whose adoption the commission itself has called for 
it is important in this field to implement measures relating to the mutual recognition of judicial decisions and we believe that on the basis of work already done it will be possible at least in the field of seizure of assets for measures to be adopted in the near future to provide for mutual recognition of judicial decisions 
lastly then europol which started its work in 
the french presidency has passed an important working document to us which sets out various scenarios for addressing and resolving the issues of democratic control and judicial control of europol 
the portuguese presidency will shortly be presenting a working document on the eurojust network since although it is not obviously necessary for judicial control of europol to be a matter for eurojust this option cannot be ruled out at present 
i believe that in this context and in the context of the dialogue that the council and parliament will have to establish on the future of europol and eurojust it will be possible for us to find an acceptable institutional solution to the relationship between the council and parliament with regard to europol 
i believe that it will be possible to find a definitive solution to this question as part of the process of resolving the issue of democratic control of europol and that this solution will encourage and reinforce institutional cooperation between all parties involved 
mr president members of the council ladies and gentlemen first of all without wishing to compete with the ministers as regards emotions i have to say that i am not moved rather i am disturbed to have two personal friends in the presidency for the first time and i just hope that this fact will not alter the separation of powers which is essential for the proper functioning of the union 
i would also like to thank mrs terrón i cusí for having asked the question which has given rise to the first annual debate of this parliamentary term on the establishment of an area of freedom security and justice and to thank all the members who in their various committees have actively participated in preparing this annual debate 
i would also like to thank the representatives of the national parliaments and of civil society 
i believe that i can say with conviction and also with satisfaction that was both a turning point and a year of consolidation by the union on issues of freedom security and justice 
it has already been mentioned that the treaty of amsterdam came into force in may and this parliament stated that the most far-reaching innovation in this treaty was its recognition of the need to establish an area of freedom security and justice 
at the same time it also represents a quantum leap in qualitative terms and a logical and vital step in the development of the union in the wake of the establishment of the internal market the introduction of the single currency and the launching of a common foreign and security policy 
this project is not so much a project of the institutions as a project of the citizens of our common union 
and it will therefore be necessary to guarantee genuine freedom of movement to all citizens residing in the territory of the european union recognising that this is only meaningful if it is rooted in a secure base with solid foundations in an effective judicial system to which everyone can have easy access on equal terms and in which our citizens can have real confidence 
i would like to emphasise the strong political message sent out by the european council reaffirming the importance that the heads of state and government of the union attached to a fundamental project together with various political guidelines and priorities which will turn this area into a reality following a progressive strategy within a time-frame of five years and that above all the three components of this area should be in balance freedom security and justice 
as i have already said on a number of occasions i am in favour the commission is in favour of drawing up a charter which would reflect on the broadest basis possible and as part of a dynamic process the common constitutional traditions of the member states and the general principles of community law rather than being a mere statement of the lowest common denominator 
that is the only way in which we can help to restore the legitimacy of the project of an enlarged european union in the eyes of every european citizen an enlarged europe based on respect for rights and freedoms with a guarantee of personal safety and safety of property and with effective legal protection in other words a union rooted in the political values which underpin contemporary democracies 
i must not overlook the fact that marked the beginning of the parliamentary term of the european parliament that it was the year in which the new commission took up its duties and as a consequence the year in which a commissioner solely responsible for the areas of justice and home affairs assumed his responsibilities 
in addition to these events i would like to remind parliament of some items that were approved in 
in the field of immigration borders and asylum the commission presented a proposal for a regulation on setting up the eurodac database and a proposal for a directive on conditions for admitting third country nationals into member states of the european union with a view to reuniting families as part of a vigorous policy of integrating legal residents in the territory of the european union 
we also presented a communication on common procedures concerning asylum and a recommendation for a decision authorising the commission to open negotiations with iceland and norway on an agreement designed to extend the rules applied by the member states of the european union under the dublin convention to those two countries 
the commission made an active contribution to the work of the high level group on asylum and migration and ultimately in december it presented a proposal aimed at establishing a european refugee fund 
in the field of judicial cooperation the commission presented proposals for regulations aimed at the communitisation of certain conventions 
in we also presented a communication on victims of crime in the european union which led to discussions that were given greater impetus at tampere 
this communication called for minimum standards for protecting the victims of crime in particular as regards their access to justice and their rights to compensation including the cost of justice 
we also presented a proposal for a decision on combating fraud and forgery of non-cash means of payment 
in the field of european union legislation on combating financial crime the commission presented a proposal for an amended directive on money laundering 
in the commission also presented its contribution towards a european action plan to combat drugs which underpins the strategy approved by the helsinki european council 
this list of actions which is not exhaustive should here today in the presence of the council presidency and of the members of this house help to make it clear that while was a year of consolidation for eu action in this key area it also i very much hope represented the start of a new phase marked by the desire to speed up the establishment of an area of freedom security and justice 
in other words will be a test of the political will to take amsterdam seriously and to help to build the foundations for an enlarged political union for the next decade a test for the council for parliament and for the commission 
as i have already said the commission is aware of its own responsibilities and it is accordingly putting the finishing touches to an initial proposal for a scoreboard so that the institutions and other interested parties can assess the progress made in implementing the required measures and in complying with the deadlines set down in the treaty of amsterdam in the vienna action plan and in the conclusions of the tampere european council 
this scoreboard will not just be a mere instrument of legislative planning 
it is for the public therefore that we are developing the area of freedom security and justice 
the progress made will not be due to the commission nor to the council nor even to the european parliament but to a combination of european institutions and to the member states themselves in as much as as has already been pointed out here specific tasks on the scoreboard will be entrusted to the member states under the principle of subsidiarity 
in the coming weeks i shall be making a tour of capitals to sound out the opinions of the various ministers for justice and home affairs 
i hope to have a debate with the european parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project 
and we hope during the portuguese presidency to present the final version to the justice and home affairs council taking account of the soundings that i have just mentioned 
it is my intention that this scoreboard should become an instrument providing political and strategic guidance to all the institutions and that it should also be an instrument for public scrutiny 
for this reason and i believe that this is a challenge we are all facing i recognise the need to develop a communication strategy which will allow us to make the real added value which the union brings to daily life accessible and visible to the public at large in areas which are essential for citizenship for legality and ultimately for democracy itself 
in addition to the scoreboard i would like to anticipate the following initiatives that the commission intends to present during and i would like to emphasise that i am delighted the portuguese presidency is treating progress in the area of freedom security and justice as a priority in its work programme 
i hope that in conjunction with the portuguese presidency it will be possible to achieve a clear spirit of interinstitutional cooperation which is also the political message of tampere and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be carried forward by subsequent presidencies 
regarding immigration and asylum the commission intends to present proposals for creating a community instrument on the temporary protection of refugees to initiate an analysis of criteria and conditions for improving implementation of the dublin convention and consideration of a possible change in its legal basis in accordance with the treaty of amsterdam to continue the debate on the basis of the communication already published concerning standards for a common asylum process throughout the union and to present proposals with a view to preparing legislation on the granting of residence permits to victims of trafficking in human beings who cooperate with judicial action against networks of traffickers 
i also intend to contribute to the process of clarifying the role of action plans as part of the work of the high level group on asylum and migration and to make progress in adapting community agreements in the field of readmission by including standard clauses 
furthermore on the subject of crossing the external borders of member states which is a central issue regarding the free movement of persons i shall in the next few days be presenting a proposal for a regulation updating the list of third countries whose nationals are required to hold visas for crossing the external borders 
turning to judicial cooperation in addition to an initiative on the law applicable to non-contractual obligations i sincerely hope that it will be possible to present to the council a proposal for minimum standards ensuring an appropriate level of legal aid in cross-border proceedings 
i also intend to continue discussions on the preparation of specific common procedural rules for simplifying and speeding up cross-border judicial proceedings relating to small commercial and consumer claims alimony claims and non-contested claims 
as a follow-up to the tampere and helsinki conclusions the commission will be presenting its contribution to the preparation of a european union strategy to combat organised crime 
we will be organising and supporting actions including in particular the debate on the need for a legislative programme on implementing mutual recognition of judicial decisions in criminal matters 
the commission also intends to present specific measures in the field of crime prevention so as to encourage exchanges of best practice in this area and in particular the prevention of urban and juvenile delinquency we further intend to present a legal basis for a programme financed by the community for this purpose 
the commission will fulfil the remit given to it at tampere to present proposals for approving definitions criminal charges and common sanctions in the field of trafficking in human beings economic exploitation of immigrants and sexual exploitation of woman and children with special emphasis on combating the use of new means of communication notably the internet for distributing child pornography 
we are also preparing a communication to instigate a debate on means of ensuring greater security in the information and knowledge society and in combating computer crime 
the year also marks the start of the implementation of the european union drugs strategy 
in this field the commission in conjunction with the portuguese presidency and the european parliament will give its full support to the interinstitutional conference to be held on drugs in february 
the recent restoring of certain internal border controls leads me to believe that we need a detailed analysis of the conditions for adopting a legislative instrument based on article of the treaty 
nevertheless i must make it clear that all these actions will of course have to take into account the principles agreed at the helsinki european council concerning applicant countries so that those applicants can cooperate and also be associated as quickly as possible with this project of creating an area of freedom security and justice 
furthermore it is important to remember that will see the start of the justice and home affairs negotiations with the first group of applicant countries and i anticipate that we will be in a position to make substantial progress in preparing the negotiating dossiers on the second group with which it was agreed to open accession negotiations at helsinki 
lastly i would like to state once again that the commission intends to be in the pole position in presenting proposals for implementing the treaty of amsterdam 
i hope that the commission and the council can reach agreement on their respective roles in exercising their right to initiatives and in carrying forward the legislative process itself 
as i have told parliament the task before us is immense and ambitious and the commission needs to have the necessary human resources to respond to this challenge 
we hope that we can count on the support of parliament and why not say it of the council to secure these resources and to achieve these objectives so that the establishment of an area of freedom security and justice becomes a reality as soon as possible thus allowing us all to contribute in a spirit of interinstitutional cooperation to the realisation of this project which is without a doubt the jewel in the crown of the treaty of amsterdam 
commissioner vitorino although i would describe cooperation with you as harmonious and profitable words have often failed me in the past when faced with the conduct which the council has demonstrated towards us 
it looked as mr schulz once aptly said in committee as if the council understood the area of freedom security and justice to mean an area in which the council has free rein security from parliament and the right to do and order as it will 
minister gomes i have of course heard what you have said and i hope that cooperation will clearly improve in this respect during the portuguese presidency 
i should like to raise three points which for us as members of the ppe group must be focal points when such an area is created 
first a common asylum law must be created and the burden of absorbing refugees must be distributed 
the council must start by at long last ensuring that eurodac is adopted in order to create the basic requirement for classifying asylum seekers 
as far as a european asylum law is concerned a start was in fact made at vienna and tampere 
unfortunately however it has highlighted the difficulties rather than proposing solutions 
i therefore call on the council representatives to look beyond their national boundaries and bring about a uniform asylum procedure for the whole union 
similarly it cannot be right for just a few member states willing to provide help to bear the entire burden of refugee misery on our continent 
agreement on burden sharing must therefore be at the top of the agenda 
secondly the introduction of a europe-wide fight against organised crime including by europol and eurojust 
the planned introduction of eurojust is one of our significant successes from tampere and must now be implemented forthwith 
we welcome the fact that europol has finally been able to start work 
we are not just calling for more control and more control over europol our motto here is less is sometimes more 
with most of europol employees currently engaged in self-control for the purposes of data protection laws and questions being asked by national parliaments we may have a great deal of control but it is inefficient control 
we want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the european parliament without hampering the work of europol 
at the same time we support the establishment of a european police academy as suggested in tampere as a step in the right direction 
if the establishment of such an area in which the union can also intervene in the basic rights of the citizens is only decided by diplomats and bureaucrats while the elected representatives of europe are reduced to following developments like a rabbit watching a snake then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizens 
there is therefore an urgent need to grant parliament codecision rights in this respect and as we have already said to strengthen the principle of democratic control 
we want an area of freedom security and justice for the citizens of europe not against them 
mr president i have nothing further to say to the council 
the previous speaker has quoted me from the last committee meeting and said it all 
why does the council find it so hard to work with us in creating an area of freedom security and justice 
i find this question more and more worrying 
allow me to try and elucidate it a little from my point of view 
the establishment of an area of freedom security and justice hovers at the interface between the constituent elements of national sovereignty 
the police and judicial policy are quite clearly elements of sovereignty in other words sensitive political areas in the member states and shifting the interface of these and communitising these policies i.e delegating powers from the national capitals from lisbon berlin or paris to brussels represents a transfer of power 
of course it is very very difficult to break away from the executive forms which have been handed down to us even if we recognise that police cooperation is necessary we can only fight international crime at european level 
so we have to draw our conclusions and say that we need legal and organisational communitisation of the instruments available 
as a result the governments which need to do this and which recognise that need also realise that in implementing this they are taking away their own powers 
then there is the european parliament which is also complicated 
it has not quite taken off in the european parliament and the council meets behind closed doors 
if the establishment of an area of freedom security and justice is kept secret then we shall not win the citizens over to it 
in other words the stability of democracy is at stake if we discuss it 
this is why i frequently get so worked up but not over the council of ministers 
generally they too are elected members of parliament mr gomes mr costa commissioner vitorino in principle we are all in the same boat 
however i should like to make an appeal to the council apparatchiks 
the following principle applies he who prepares decisions in this case the council apparatchiks anticipates the decisions which is why the council apparatchiks should demonstrate more democratic spirit 
i should just like to mention another aspect briefly because i do not have much time 
scoreboard sounds like skateboard in german 
i say therefore that we need a timetable which stipulates what must be implemented when and by whom 
this vitorino plan is what we need clear precise projects with a clear defined timetable 
mr vitorino whom i would like to thank for his speech can give us that provided that he has the necessary financial and human resources 
let us give him those resources then he can get on with his job and we all stand to gain 
i warmly welcome the fact that the portuguese presidency is making justice and home affairs one of its top priorities or jewels in the crown 
perhaps that will end scandals like the failure of states to deploy in kosovo the police they promised 
i just want to highlight three areas among many where we need quick progress 
the first is asylum 
it is essential to establish a single european system but one based on fairness full respect for the geneva convention and decent reception conditions including an end to routine detention 
decisions on asylum should take months not years 
the second area is that of freedom freedom to move and reside wherever one wishes in the union freedom of information freedom to vote for all who have european citizenship and that includes not just member state citizens but third country nationals 
let our citizens know that our common policies in justice and home affairs are about freedom not just about repression 
the last area i want to mention is convergence of civil and criminal justice systems 
eurosceptics claim that this is a threat to sovereignty the end of the nation-state and so on 
but the case of the suspect wanted for questioning in connection with the murders of three women in france including british student isabel peake who was thrown off a train shows why we need mutual recognition 
arrested and released in madrid he is now being extradited after arrest in lisbon 
whatever the eurosceptics say it is in all our interests to get cooperation in such matters 
finally as has already been said it is essential and i hope that the igc will cover this to move to codecision with the european parliament in these areas with democratic and judicial scrutiny 
mr president all i can say about is this how wonderful to feel the portuguese summer after the finnish winter 
i hope that it works out 
the tampere summit was certainly an important milestone in for europe and for the area of freedom security and justice in particular 
numerous questions are still outstanding 
answers are still awaited 
since tampere there has been an imbalance between positive action and mere declarations of intent 
regulations on nationality and the integration of people from third countries are still outstanding 
on the other hand quite specific action has been called for on the subject of safety of life 
the creation of a charter of fundamental rights will be one of the important projects in the immediate future 
however it is difficult to predict what the content of this charter will be and how it will be implemented legally when you think of the people who are not currently citizens of the union 
the europol agreement has now officially entered into force 
in tampere the question of granting operational powers was discussed 
we continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control 
the agreement also attracts criticism with regard to eurodac 
parliament has amended the contractual text 
unfortunately no initiatives have yet materialised regarding other matters and we still await them 
europe as an area of freedom security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors 
and yet we owe this to the citizens of europe 
having listened to the justice and home affairs ministers i am optimistic and i am assuming that we will succeed in the next six months 
mr president commissioner the oral question tabled by mrs terrón i cusí shows that this house is taking a firm stance 
indeed six months after the election of this new parliament we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of europe 
i believe that the portuguese presidency can contribute positively to this 
we are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom security and justice particularly social justice 
yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems 
this is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres 
for europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged 
a proper plan for fighting unemployment must be established for this is the scourge which is allowing the rise of racism xenophobia nationalism and extreme-right racist movements 
we should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees 
the virtually systematic conditions of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seekers are no longer acceptable 
all asylum-seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect 
last week and somewhat by chance i witnessed at roissy airport a scene of rare violence in which two young women admittedly illegal immigrants were being returned to conakry 
they were treated like the worst criminals 
they were stripped naked and dragged along the floor by their hair surrounded by a horde of state security police 
the portuguese presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour 
our role should be to accompany reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships 
the commission has proposed creating a european fund for refugees to which parliament was favourably disposed 
instead of all this waffling about the budget granted to this fund we could take the decision to set this up 
the presidency and the council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in tampere even though this summit provided an important basis 
likewise we cannot simply record the rise in xenophobic feelings in europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide-ranging action 
the laws against racism must be harmonised 
what direction do you intend to give to article of the ec treaty 
what do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wages for men and women 
how do you aim to eradicate homophobia racism and sexism 
we must take the best from each of our countries 
when six european countries have granted the right to vote the president of this house can venture to extend this right to vote and eligibility to participate in the municipal and european elections to all people from outside the community who have lived in europe for more than five years 
the regularisation of illegal immigrants in certain countries including your own must act as an example to others 
these illegal immigrants nowadays constitute a plethora of vulnerable people at the mercy of slum landlords an oppressed workforce subject to economic exploitation rendering them modern-day slaves 
in more general terms this presidency must start to change the behaviour and interaction of our people with minority groups and immigrants 
immigration is too often a synonym for insecurity and violence and purely repressive responses 
how do you intend to make our people understand that today like always immigration is a source of social and cultural wealth with a role which is and will remain essential in the context of population 
what action do you intend to take to enhance the place of immigrants in our society and to guarantee proper protection for asylum-seekers 
mr president there is a great lack of transparency in the area of security freedom and justice 
the european union is an economic powerhouse but we are not in a position to pontificate when it comes to our treatment of refugees 
the level of racism in our society is terrifying 
ireland for generations sent her sons and daughters to places of safety throughout the world but now when the celtic tiger is providing wealth and prosperity beyond our expectations we are showing a very ugly side to our character 
racism in ireland is endemic 
it has been a relative shock to our political leaders to find we must now take a share of the refugees that have been coming into the european union for a long time 
we are coming from behind in dealing with the issue and the government is doing its utmost to catch up 
there is a willingness but fear pervades and to assuage this fear we must find political and religious leadership not only in ireland but throughout the european union 
mr president we take note that the excuse-making reticent presidency which in recent months has prevented us from holding a debate such as the one we have been able to hold today has come to an end 
nevertheless to avoid the customary circus which every six months has us indiscriminately attacking the presidency of the council maybe parliament should find the courage to undertake incisive political action so that the next intergovernmental conference will decide to increase codecision with immediate effect and not wait for another five years 
the two identical-sounding questions which are under discussion are of course underpinned by a mantra of the kind which in recent years has increasingly transformed politics into a type of ideology fine-sounding but pernicious 
and our current eu mantra is afsj area for freedom security and justice 
behind this lies another ambition on the part of the commission and of the council and of the overwhelming majority of this house namely to introduce such an area 
and who is not in favour of security freedom and justice 
the problem is just that this is not something the eu can introduce by means of legislative decrees and other supranational resolutions 
freedom security and justice are the root system of any society reflecting its history corporate experience and political development 
but it is precisely here that we find the real rationale behind the mantra concerning security freedom and justice 
the agenda is not designed to secure justice for the citizen 
that is already secured by means of the various national legal systems 
it is concerned with increased integration which as part of a duplicitous package involves increased repression and control 
you just have to think of all the resolutions concerning fort europa schengen eurodac etc 
any democrat can spot two key problems 
first of all the initiatives which have been planned are completely unrealistic 
it also of course finds indirect expression in the question 
but secondly the projects will put a strain on indeed will be injurious to the national democracies 
as long as the eu revolved around the internal market only the body was being attacked 
now it is the soul 
mr president today the people of northern ireland see a strange irony 
we had commissioner patten speaking in this house in defence of freedom security and justice and yet his report before the british house of commons this afternoon which has been accepted will do away with the royal ulster constabulary and its reserves and put the people of northern ireland of both religious sections into the hands of the terrorists 
the ira terrorists have not given up any of their weapons nor have the loyalist terrorists yet the police are being forced into a position where they will not have the power to resist the terrorist community 
let me just look at the figures from the day that the agreement was signed 
in we had murders 
in we had murders and that does not include the omagh bomb where were killed and injured 
between and loyalists assaulted and shot people while republicans assaulted and shot people 
charges brought against loyalists in totalled while those against republicans totalled 
since january there have been six shootings by loyalists and two by republicans loyalists have been involved in six serious assaults one leading to another murder while republicans have engaged in five serious assaults 
mr president that situation cannot continue and needs remedying 
mr president the treaty of amsterdam has set an important objective for the union 
this is a task which all meps the council and the commission must take on during this legislature the creation as has been said already of an area of freedom security and justice 
the tampere council the motor and architect of this objective has proposed certain goals but five years the time scale laid down for the implementation of chapter iv of the treaty is too long to wait for the urgent solution which some problems require 
my first point is that parliament must not be excluded from the important decisions to be taken in this area and that its participation in the decision-making process must be guaranteed especially with regard to this project which affects the citizens as the commissioner has explained very well 
my second point is that we must make rapid progress in the adoption of a common asylum system adopting common procedural rules and above all putting an end to the current confusion between migration for political reasons and migration for economic reasons 
the recent laws on aliens adopted in my country spain and in belgium are a reminder that there is an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy 
my third and final point relates to the external activities of the union in the field of immigration and asylum 
we must not and cannot give the impression that the union exclusively wishes to defend itself from an avalanche of refugees and economic migrants 
we must opt for a policy of cooperating in the development of our neighbouring countries in the east and the mediterranean area but we must do so with rigour with economic means and in close collaboration with public institutions which must cooperate in the protection of those citizens whose most basic rights are violated or who wish to emigrate in order to meet their most essential needs 
finally in relation to the charter of fundamental rights the citizens of europe need to have a vision of citizenship 
the euro employment even security are not enough 
mr president unlike some of the previous speakers i want to go back to the words of our portuguese ministers and mr vitorino 
this trio's words were like music to our ears as mr ceyhun has said 
as with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated 
many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months 
the tune that will be played will be one that the people of europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune 
as described this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant tunes we heard during the european election and over the last few months 
the amsterdam treaty and the tampere council built on this project for an area of freedom security and justice in the european union 
one area though is extremely important and this house must be involved in it namely scrutiny 
there is so much legislation and i very much welcome the portuguese programme that was outlined to us last week but we need to be absolutely sure that it is scrutinised that the people in this parliament and the members of the national parliaments and the citizens of europe are aware of everything involved in it 
and we must make certain that the details are applicable appropriate and relevant to the different countries 
i should like to draw attention to some of the aspects of the resolutions before us this afternoon one or two of which were referred to earlier on 
i welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime 
that is an area that european citizens will respond to and will be happy about 
but the commission and council must know that there are many people in this house who have reservations about the eurodac system for example 
we accept the predominant role of the council in this but there are reservations and i am sure that the council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail 
anyone who is english or british or follows cricket knows what a scoreboard is 
a scoreboard tells people the score it has to be up-to-date and it has to be clear and visible 
i am sure that commissioner vitorino will make certain that is so 
at the end of six months i hope that the music is still playing and that the european people are still listening 
mr president i would like to welcome the president-in-office and his colleague from the justice ministry mr costa and to thank them for the welcome they gave my committee in lisbon last week and the constructive meetings we enjoyed 
amsterdam and tampere have given us much work to do together as the excellent draft resolution by mrs terrón today shows 
i would like to make three brief points 
the first is that we need a mature dialogue between the council and the european parliament 
it is barely six months since amsterdam imposed a duty on our two organisations to work together we have been sizing each other up we have had a few minor spats but we need to work effectively together 
let us stop the shadow-boxing 
let us drop the elaborate charades and let us respect the duties that the treaties impose on us and the timescales allowed for full democratic debate 
involve us please in your discussions on both policy and process 
let us not pretend that national parliaments are able to exercise effective democratic control of government activities in this area 
my second point is that we need a properly resourced commission 
we have established a new directorate-general yet it has only people all told 
there is an agreement to double this number but i understand that so far not a single new person has arrived 
we are setting the commission a massive task not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard 
the council and parliament must work together to provide the resources that the commission needs 
finally on the content of the debate i welcome the fact that the presidency has put the area of freedom security and justice at the top of its agenda 
all good things come in threes especially in our policy area 
two hundred years ago it was liberty equality and fraternity and things went along very well until the governments of the left raised equality above the others 
now it is freedom security and justice and i hope that the current governments of the left will heed the words of commissioner vitorino and resist the temptation to elevate security important as it is above the equally important needs of freedom and justice 
although the main achievements in the construction of an area of freedom security and justice should be mentioned we must remember that there is still room for progress 
the role of the court of justice is still too limited and communitisation is incomplete 
the unilateral decision by belgium to re-establish border controls is a clear illustration of this 
the decision to establish a charter of fundamental rights is to be welcomed but it is difficult to predict whether its content and legal scope will be restrictive or symbolic including all people whatever their nationality or excluding some 
the total lack of progress in european citizenship and the political rights of all european residents is to be regretted 
although action plans established by the high-level working group aim to limit migratory flows in the future these plans do nothing to improve human rights civil liberties and the economic situation in the countries concerned 
we know that readmission clauses are included in the cooperation and association agreements 
furthermore it should be noted that these provisions were adopted within the council by a procedure without debate and without consulting parliament 
however the main concern remains 
mr president i would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of the council as well as the commissioner 
i thank them for their statements to the house 
rather than go back over the areas that have already been covered i would like to deal with one specific topic the question of drugs and how we tackle the pervasiveness of the drug culture in our societies 
i look to the portuguese presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the finnish presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the member states 
we already have on the international side plans in place to combat drug trafficking money laundering and so on 
but to bring it down to a more human level to give assistance to those people who are trying to come off drugs and give them proper controls and proper mechanisms for rehabilitation secondly to coordinate amongst the police forces and the judiciary with regard to common penalties and common laws thirdly to undertake an information and awareness campaign for young people and once and for all to put an end to these very dangerous words of normalisation and harm reduction and show that any weakening of our resolve in making sure that drugs are not legalised must be for the good of all our people 
mr president i would like to use the few seconds of speaking time to which i am entitled to point out or remind the representative of the commission that in belgium the government is currently pursuing a policy under which thousands and possibly tens of thousands of illegal aliens are being legalised and are to receive permanent right of residence right to be reunited with their families etc 
this is a belgian government measure which flies in the face of the schengen treaty 
i lodged a written complaint on the same subject to commissioner vitorino on december 
i would ask him to take this complaint into consideration and inform me within the foreseeable future of the steps the commission will take to penalise this violation of the schengen treaty by the belgian state in accordance with article of the treaty 
mr president esteemed gentlemen from portugal especially the council representatives you face great expectations on our part 
i should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment 
i refer to eurodac 
you will remember that we decided with great expectations here in the european parliament in december that eurodac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system as a community instrument which we urgently need in order to prevent multiple asylum applications in order to have an instrument to fight illegality and above all in order to set out clearly which member state was responsible for implementing the asylum procedure 
we voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument together with an implementation committee which would be attached to the commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be 
we were of the opinion that eurodac was becoming a reality 
even in tampere we were of the opinion that eurodac was becoming a reality 
however the council then took another direction at the very next summit in december and took a huge step backwards by deciding what we had absolutely rejected i.e that the council should continue to be responsible for implementation that the regulatory committee would be attached to the council and that where possible gibraltar would still be used to exert pressure 
this is a perfect example of the sort of work we do not want to see 
my urgent request on behalf of the group is that you do everything to ensure that eurodac is implemented immediately as an instrument to fight asylum abuse and illegality and as an instrument to speed up asylum procedures 
if you tell us today how you wish to proceed you will be doing us a great service 
mr president ministers commissioner the harvest of decisions was indeed rich so much so that it became difficult to gather i.e to put those decisions into practice 
i refer in particular to the council and to the inertia of the member states in implementing the decisions they had jointly made 
however the past year was positively marked by some momentous decisions such as the decision to begin implementing the treaty of amsterdam the decision to incorporate the schengen agreement into the community pillar and the decision of the cologne council to create a charter of fundamental rights and the decision of the extraordinary european council in tampere to bind the member states to common directions priorities and goals with a view to creating a common area of freedom security and justice 
without wishing to ignore the progress which has been made we the european parliament would like to draw your attention to the unwillingness on the part of the council to implement these decisions in many areas as well as its lack of common vision and in particular the lack of transparency and cooperation with the european parliament 
from what i have said it must be obvious to you that the european parliament is not prepared to simply play the role of observer 
neither will it stop raising vital issues 
for example how much progress are you willing to make and what measures legislative or otherwise will you be taking to combat the scourge of trafficking in human beings child pornography on the internet drugs and organised crime 
do you intend to press for a common policy for asylum and immigration 
how do you intend to go about integrating immigrants into the community reuniting them with their families and recognising their rights and duties on an equal footing with those of the citizens of europe 
in light of this new international demographic class portrayed by experts at the un is it not about time you abandoned your traditional conservative views on refugees and immigrants 
i have great expectations for the portuguese presidency 
mr president i welcome much indeed most of what has been said in this debate 
but i want to add a word of caution 
we risk having not too few charters of rights in this community but too many national european union and european convention not too few tribunals having the final say about our rights but possibly too many there is the court across the river there there is the court in luxembourg 
there are also courts in karlsruhe london lisbon dublin and edinburgh 
we must make sure that what we do makes clear sense 
we must not generate a confusion and conflict of jurisdictions about rights for that would be the enemy of freedom justice and security 
we need in short to have and to sustain the highest possible common standards and to find ways of securing these 
but we must look always to subsidiarity 
like everybody in this house i want freedom justice and security 
i do not want to see these degenerate into over-centralisation chaos and confusion 
madam president ladies and gentlemen i would very quickly like to make one point 
various members raised questions about the portuguese presidency 
the president of parliament has made us aware of the very limited time at our disposal and my colleague the minister for justice and i therefore propose to reply objectively to all the questions put here at the parliamentary committee meeting which we shall be attending next week 
thank you minister 
the debate is closed 
their efficiency has been truly remarkable 
i will save a few seconds because i wanted to propose to the council that we continue the debate at the next meeting of the committee on citizens' rights and freedoms justice and home affairs 
then we will have the opportunity to comment on these replies and to express our concerns to the commission as well 
personally i am pleased with some of the replies for example in relation to issues as sensitive as schengen and the europol convention which we hope will be reviewed and i am pleased with the words of the minister for justice with regard to trying to bring them under the jurisdiction of the judicial authorities 
i also hope that the same is done in relation to parliamentary control 
representatives of the council within the next month we are going to table a motion for a resolution in this parliament 
i am sure that with the willingness that you have shown today the first thing you will do in this new climate of understanding between us will be to take account of the motion for a resolution which we will submit to you 
we will examine questions to the council 
subject construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone turkey the two recent earthquakes in turkey registering more than on the richter scale raise tremendous doubts about turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at akkuyu while energy reserves produced by the atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the eu spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes 
turkey's nuclear plans b which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of turkey and the surrounding region b prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of canadian origin of the type acquired by india and pakistan 
what steps will the council take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the eu but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the eu budget 
mr president the council wishes to point out that turkey is a signatory to the convention on nuclear safety the objectives of which should allay the fears expressed by mr souladakis 
the aim of this convention which came into force on october is precisely to achieve and maintain a high standard of nuclear safety at world level by means of national measures and through international cooperation 
it further aims to ensure that nuclear installations are equipped with continuing protection against potential radiological risks so as to protect individuals society at large and the environment against the harmful effects of the ionising radiation that can be emitted by such installations 
the convention as you will be aware also covers the prevention of accidents which have radiological effects and the limitation of such effects when incidents of this kind occur 
i would also like to remind members that as a candidate for membership of the european union turkey will and this is a pre-accession condition which is an important point sooner or later as part of its own pre-accession strategy have to adopt a set of policies geared towards adopting the entire acquis communautaire in good time and including therefore all provisions already in force on nuclear safety 
thank you for your answer 
however i would just like to add the following 
turkey is only looking to increase its energy potential by % with this unit 
nevertheless rumour has it that it plans to buy candu reactors of the type acquired by pakistan and india which were used for nuclear weapons 
my second point concerns the safety of these plants 
in areas of high seismic risk it is not enough just to have secure earthquake-proof buildings 
speaking as an engineer i can tell you that we carry out tests to investigate the effects of certain risk factors in extreme circumstances 
however we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation it is just not possible 
with this in mind it goes without saying that nuclear plants a priori should not be built in areas prone to earthquakes 
in this respect and because turkey is situated on the periphery of the european union we should be helping it to become a more secure peaceful and cooperative country 
that is our role and this is the point of my question 
i recognise the relevance of the arguments that mr souladakis has put forward 
this is of course a highly sensitive issue 
it also affects other states neighbouring the eu with which we maintain relations 
this question will naturally be one of our key concerns and the european commission will not fail to take this into account 
this report includes as you are aware statements for the minutes with votes against abstentions and explanations of vote 
since may that is to say since the entry into force of the treaty of amsterdam itself this report has also contained the acts for which the council does not act in its capacity as a legislative body except for certain acts of limited importance such as decisions of a procedural nature 
in this case the report may also contain the results of a vote if the council sees fit 
since the treaty of amsterdam came into force and whenever the council has acted in its legislative capacity and this is an important distinction in terms of the way ministerial meetings work the results and the explanations of vote as well as the statements recorded in the minutes have to all intents and purposes been published on a regular basis 
as you know any such proposal will have to be tabled in accordance with the provisions of the treaty of amsterdam that is within two years of the entry into force of the treaty of amsterdam or in other words before may 
you will understand that as the council has as yet not received any proposal from the commission in this regard i cannot answer the detailed points you have raised in your questions 
thank you mr president and thank you president-in-office of the council 
i am sure the president-in-office of the council is a very nice man and is very kind to his wife and his children and his dog 
however forgive me if i am a little sceptical of the reply you have just given me 
i do not believe that the statements made within the council and the votes are available to the public immediately 
will you please therefore undertake before the next plenary in february to write and tell me where i can find this information on behalf of the public immediately the council has passed legislation rather than waiting for it to come out weeks later on a press release list 
will you write to me before the next plenary with that information 
mr newton dunn i would first like to say that i do not appreciate the kind of personal comments with which you started your second question and i would be grateful if you could refrain from making such comments in future 
with regard to what you were saying it makes me think that the criticism levelled at the council apart from being formulated in a very specific way of which we also take note does not actually refer to the opacity shall we say of the legislative process but rather almost to an excess of transparency 
however i would like to say mr newton dunn that the results of this kind of process for transparency are quite obvious to us and we consider them to be unquestionable 
we have no problem mr newton dunn in repeating this information to you in writing but we will not be able to go any further than what has been said here because that meets the requirements of the treaty exactly 
i do not consider that the council tried to answer my question 
i did not ask what the council thought of the proposal which the commission has still not tabled 
instead my question concerns the interpretation in principle of article of the treaty of amsterdam 
does this permit legislation also to be passed concerning national laws on transparency and not only in connection with the three institutions of the european union referred to there 
i should like to have an answer to that question 
mr sjöstedt the answer that i gave was the only answer possible 
nevertheless i would like to say that any interpretation of article of the treaty must also be linked to the principle of subsidiarity 
at the moment there are no concrete proposals which would allow us to make adjustments under this article and unless there is such a proposal we cannot move forward on this matter 
in any event article does not at first sight allow work to be done on any basis that could affect the principle of subsidiarity 
i am up to a point concerned about how the council will fight for the principles contained in the treaty of amsterdam and whose purpose is to ensure that citizens have a better opportunity to participate in the decision-making process 
mrs frahm the question that you raised is extremely important and we discussed it at great length during the last intergovernmental conference 
i would like to say that transparency does not only apply from the community institutions outwards it also applies between the institutions 
as a matter of fact at the last conference this issue was raised and discussed on several occasions 
the european parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next intergovernmental conference 
the matter is still open 
genuine transparency of the institutions' workings and the way they are presented throughout europe is an extremely important issue and one which in my opinion needs to be studied again particularly in the context of the forthcoming intergovernmental conference 
we have no doubts about this and we think that the members taking part in this preparatory group will have an opportunity to raise this issue again 
for our part we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area 
it is a very important question indeed which jonas sjöstedt and others have asked 
we have a principle of transparency in sweden which strengthens democracy and ensures that there is a worthwhile dialogue between citizens decision makers and authorities 
we are very anxious indeed that the eu too should move in this direction and this is also stated in the treaty of amsterdam 
one or two years ago parliament adopted a report by mrs lööw which is extremely important in this context 
the report warned that the forthcoming process would lead to restrictions upon the transparency of the member states 
we can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this warning from parliament 
i want to ask the council if it understands this warning in view of what we have now seen in the working documents from the commission 
mrs hedkvist petersen there is something we should all be aware of there is not necessarily a huge gulf between the views of the council and parliament and between the views of the members of the council and the members of this parliament on the advantages or disadvantages of transparency 
people sometimes get the idea that the council is the place where issues are dealt with in an opaque way and that parliament is where they are dealt with in a transparent way 
this is not true 
we share your concerns about the way the institutions operate and the effects that this can have externally 
we therefore have the same concerns and interpret fundamental principles in the same way 
what may be true mrs hedkvist petersen is that occasionally we do not have the same views on the exact way in which the transparency process itself may or may not work in terms of genuine transparency 
by this i mean that it is often dangerous to imagine that publishing a certain kind of document or that ensuring transparency in some of the institutions are factors that will improve the democratic nature of these institutions because in reality this is frequently not the case 
we know and i do not want to go into this in any great depth that when on occasion transparency exceeds certain limits we automatically end up with informal conversations and deals being made behind the scenes 
we must strike an overall balance on transparency and this balance lies exactly halfway between realism and rhetoric 
i listened very carefully to what mr seixas da costa had to say on transparency and the intergovernmental conference 
my concern is if i have understood mr seixas da costa correctly on the interesting points he made as regards transparency and the igc whether the portuguese presidency will take on the commitment to tackle the issue of widening the agenda of the intergovernmental conference 
after all examining the issue of transparency in the ways the institutions operate should never be hidden away under any old heading or confined to some lobby or other though i know full well the importance of these lobbies 
it should have its own heading in the agenda of the intergovernmental conference which would mean widening the agenda 
mr dimitrakopoulos transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions 
this intergovernmental conference will at the outset concentrate on improving the way the institutions operate particularly taking account of the desire we all share for them specifically to become more democratic more transparent and more efficient 
all of this must nevertheless be done whilst respecting a broad framework that of the overall acceptability of any solutions we may devise to achieve these three aims 
it is obvious that transparency will be a permanent fixture on the european agenda and it will of course feature on the agenda of this intergovernmental conference 
i can assure you that this is an issue which the portuguese presidency will keep before the member states and the representatives of the preparatory group for the conference 
it must therefore be able to count on the support of the members of the european parliament who will surely rally behind this proposal 
we will then see at ministerial level how we can follow this up 
it should nevertheless be noted that we have just concluded the treaty of amsterdam which was approved last may and that there is a raft of implementing measures on transparency which are still in progress 
the question is whether it is premature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency 
my feeling is that in spite of everything this issue will always have to be on the agenda because the public is clearly concerned about it and because it is linked with the need to make the european institutions accountable to the public 
as far as we are concerned they will be 
we shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter 
subject proposal for a regulation laying down the total admissible catches for specific fish populations for the year and the case of anchovies in particular the latest reports from the international council for the exploration of the sea indicate that the current level of anchovy stocks in ices zone viii is critical 
does the council believe that it is permissible to consolidate future overfishing which violates the originally established tac of metric tonnes per year given the current evidence for the critical state of anchovy stocks 
what measures does the council intend to adopt and when with a view to taking proper account of the critical state of anchovy stocks the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability 
mr president the portuguese presidency is extremely anxious to give a comprehensive answer to this question particularly because it broaches an issue which concerns portugal in a positive way and i shall explain how 
the council is aware of the critical level of anchovy stocks in the bay of biscay to which mr ortuondo larrea refers 
nevertheless at the last fisheries council of held on and december the member states involved in this area of fishing namely france spain and portugal considered that applying the precautionary principle which sets a tac reduced from tonnes to tonnes as the commission proposed was excessively cautious 
a compromise solution was therefore reached in order to achieve a balance between the need to reduce the biological risks that is the species of fish being affected and the socio-economic problems caused by fishing limits 
this was achieved by fixing the tac at an intermediate level of tonnes instead of the set in 
it was also stipulated that this would be revised in the light of new scientific information on preserving species of which we hope to see examples in the first six months of this year 
as for the southern stocks of anchovy in ices zone ix the tac was fixed at tonnes for the whole of as opposed to tonnes in 
fishing quota transfers between portugal and france were reduced proportionally from tonnes in to tonnes in for fishing in french waters 
i would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on anchovy stocks overall over the whole community fishing area 
in accordance with the principle of relative stability % of stocks of anchovy in the bay of biscay are allocated to spain and only % to france 
without this transfer from portuguese waters the level of the bay of biscay tac would have to be multiplied by ten in order to grant adequate catches to france 
this situation would obviously be even more damaging to the level of stocks than the risk referred to by mr ortuondo larrea which we also understand 
mr president-in-office of the council i must say that your comments have not satisfied me at all 
i understand that portugal is affected by this 
however it seems to go against all reason and intelligence that % of the anchovies which until were being fished in the portuguese fishing grounds through an agreement between that member state portugal and france should now be fished in the bay of biscay and that the council of ministers wishes to maintain that this has no effect on the anchovy stocks in the bay of biscay or the cantabrian sea 
it has been shown as we have been claiming since that this move is appalling and if portugal and france wish to reach an agreement that is fine by us but these anchovies should be fished in portuguese fishing grounds and not in the bay of biscay 
today scientific studies show that the anchovy population in the bay of biscay is in danger of extinction and now there will be measures to restrict the amount of anchovy which can be fished in that bay 
i do not know if you are aware representatives of the council of ministers of your responsibility over these last few years and in as well for the plight of the families who live on anchovy fishing in the north of the iberian peninsular 
apart from this mr ortuondo larrea the court is of the opinion that the transfer effected between portugal and france does not violate the principle of exploiting living sea and freshwater resources in a rational and responsible way on the grounds that the fishing pressure in zones viii and ix neither increases nor adversely affects the overall quota of these resources allocated to spain 
the council therefore reiterates its opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and more damaging to population numbers than the solution which was eventually chosen 
subject measures to combat the continuing ethnic cleansing of serbs and romanies in kosovo on december nato's defence ministers made a strong appeal for an end to the ethnic cleansing of kosovo's minority communities 
in its resolution referring to specific atrocities committed against serbs and romanies parliament also vigorously condemns the continuing violence against the serb population and calls on the leaders of the kosovo albanians to fully respect un resolution 
the resolution also stresses that previous persecution of the albanians cannot constitute a pretext for killings abductions detentions intimidation arson looting destruction of property and the taking-over of houses etc 
in the light of the above will the council reconsider the funding for the reconstruction of kosovo as requested by parliament 
what other practical measures will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing 
mr alavanos i would like to say that i have the greatest sympathy for the concern underlying the issue you have raised 
we genuinely share your concerns about the threatening situation which exists in kosovo for ethnic minorities for both the serb and romany populations and the incidents of discrimination harassment and intimidation which continue to take place in that region 
the council has always stressed the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrated such acts and of those who continue to perpetrate such acts 
in our contacts with senior political figures amongst the kosovo albanians we have stressed and the portuguese prime minister did this very recently that persecution of the serb population the romany population and other ethnic groups is totally unacceptable 
it will not be tolerated and must stop immediately 
it has been communicated explicitly and repeatedly to kosovar leaders that international support will depend to a large extent on the way non-albanian minorities are treated 
we have fully supported the efforts of the united nations mission and the international security forces in kosovo to prevent further outbreaks of violence against minorities and to protect the populations under threat 
the council therefore expressed its satisfaction in its december conclusions at the substantial contributions announced by the european commission which will indirectly assist in returning the situation to normal together with similar contributions made by member states 
nevertheless mr alavanos the council is also aware that the total amount of resources made available to the appropriate international organisations in kosovo does not match the desired amount in terms of what the various member states have been able to raise and this has limited the real ability of these organisations to act on the ground 
i would like to thank mr president-in-office of the council 
i believe as i think we all do that portugal its former president mr soares and its government maintained a cautious and middle-of-the-road stance during the bombings in the balkans 
however there is some concern over the lack of progress made despite the good and honest intentions expressed by the european union 
unfortunately we have recently witnessed the eradication of serb romany turkish and croatian minorities in kosovo and we are now wondering what will happen next 
the united nation' s and mr kouchner' s mission in kosovo ended in failure 
this failure is illustrated by the fact that after an entire war that was waged to put an end to ethnic cleansing we now have ethnic cleansing from the opposite side 
and so i would like to repeat my question as to whether the council intends to take more specific action to debate these issues with mr kouchner who has a major responsibility for the situation in kosovo today 
the structure being implemented in kosovo is under the auspices of the united nations 
it is a structure to which the european union has given as much support as it can and to which the countries of the european union have contributed in various ways 
therefore the responsibility of the european union has to be seen in a certain context 
these are questions which we should all be asking but the forum for putting these questions is the united nations 
mr president mr president-in-office of the council i heartily welcome the fact that you have said that you wish to improve structures in the aim of improving the credibility of the authorities 
i think that we need to consider how we can best present this to the general public 
the question which i therefore ask myself is this has in fact a start been made on how we can promote the media in this area how we can train journalists and how we can improve information to the public on peaceful coexistence 
we have endeavoured to provide material help 
we have tried to defend peace by taking military action 
what is the situation now as regards efforts to include psychological criteria in this crisis area and provide the best possible support here 
mr rübig as i said i understand your concerns very well 
i think that at the moment particularly in the last few months there have been some positive developments in terms of the resources that will be available to mr kouchner in order for him to be able to do his job efficiently 
i heard mr kouchner speak at the council of europe ministerial meeting on this issue and i think that many of the concerns he expressed then about the lack of resources needed to overcome some of the problems have now been addressed 
in other words he has been given these resources 
there are two fundamental questions in particular 
firstly an increase in police numbers would be an important factor in guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population and in particular in protecting certain sections of the civilian population 
secondly an increase in appropriations would allow some officials who have important roles in the administrative and operational process in kosovo to be kept on 
i know that this is an extremely delicate issue but we should all be questioning the logic behind this resolution and its chances of being implemented 
we advocate that it should be implemented in its entirety 
nevertheless we must look at this resolution and this is also something that the united nations security council will probably have to do sooner or later 
we will have to do so because as has happened in the past in other contexts and in other strategically important situations across the world we must be in a position to assess a certain kind of process and a certain kind of logic and balance which were in fact the logic and the balance which led to this resolution being approved should be maintained in future 
what we have to do and we in the european union are already doing it is to guarantee mr kouchner all the necessary resources and you are right mr rübig we have a duty to our citizens to explain to them regularly and openly whether or not these resources are being properly used 
we in the council will be trying to provide information on this matter during the portuguese presidency 
mr seixas da costa i totally agree with you 
the problem is not mr kouchner but the legal basis on which he is working namely resolution 
it is the failure to define this scenario which is causing or encouraging the excesses accidents and assassinations mentioned by mr alavanos 
does the council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of kosovo 
if so does it intend to do so within a general redefinition of the region avoiding as far as possible the multiplication of micro-states as has tended to happen elsewhere and reuniting the parties in this case kosovo and albania 
however it would probably take us more than one parliamentary sitting to discuss this 
i would nevertheless like to say that we know that the situation in kosovo is also closely connected with that of all the countries and regions surrounding it 
the situation in kosovo will not be resolved in isolation 
it will be resolved when there is stability throughout the region 
this leads of course to the measures being taken within the european union both in terms of stabilising the situation in bosnia and herzegovina and in terms of the new contractual relations which we are trying to establish with the former yugoslav republic of macedonia 
there is also the raft of positive measures which we are trying to implement together with albania in addition of course to the pressure we are putting on the serbian authorities specifically the support we are providing to serbian towns with democratic structures through the energy for democracy project 
these actions taken together and as a result of the synergy between them may also create a framework for resolving the situation in kosovo 
the situation in kosovo itself will not be resolved unless there is an overall plan for stability in the region 
since the author is not present question no lapses 
subject new interreg initiative in point of annex to its draft communication on interreg entitled promotion of urban rural and coastal development the commission authorises for the renovation and development of historic urban centres using a joint cross-border strategy 
however housing is specifically excluded 
given the fact that there are many houses in rural areas which are of historic interest including small cottages and given the need for a variety of reasons to maintain rural populations and to attract people to rural areas does not the council agree that these objectives could be assisted if housing projects were funded in the areas covered by interreg 
i would like to point out that in may we adopted a new system for supporting rural development which was the fourth community reference framework for sustainable rural development 
this was as you know one of the changes made during the agenda negotiations and it changes the way in which agricultural issues are dealt with at community level 
through the european agricultural guarantee and guidance fund the eaggf this community support framework is designed to help reverse the trend of abandoning rural areas an issue you are quite right to raise 
on the other hand the european regional development fund the erdf also contributes as part of its role to promoting social and economic cohesion by redressing the main regional imbalances and encouraging rural areas to take part in development and conversion 
in this regard we should bear in mind that the erdf also contributes to promoting sustainable rural development and to creating sustainable employment in rural areas 
this combination of instruments enables us to implement a policy of rural development which today furthermore is one of the ways in which the common agricultural policy in one of its dimensions and regional policy also have developed and changed 
we think that this is one of the most fundamental issues within the concept of multifunctionality which is now associated with changes in the common agricultural policy and the eaggf of course has a crucial role to play in this 
subject farming and the portuguese presidency will the council outline the priorities of the portuguese presidency for the next six months as regards the common agricultural policy and indicate the steps it feels are necessary to boost consumer confidence in the agricultural sectors and products adversely affected by recent health scares 
on the other hand the portuguese presidency will continue if and when the new wto round begins within its term of office which is by no means guaranteed to ensure that the presence of community production on international markets is strengthened 
it will also continue to ensure a greater balance between exported community farm products and preserving the multifunctional european agriculture to which i have just referred 
the portuguese presidency also attaches importance to reinforcing food safety policy and i think that the portuguese foreign minister and president-in-office already referred to this aspect this morning 
it is therefore one of the priorities of our programme 
we shall be developing it in four parallel schemes in the agriculture council the health council the consumer affairs council and the internal market council 
at the santa maria da feira european council meeting in june the portuguese presidency will present a report on this issue specifically in the light of the information the commission presented in its white paper a few days ago 
we think that the task we now have of establishing a european agency is crucial in order to give credibility to the single market to stabilise confidence in this market to break down some of the tensions between member states in this area and even it has to be said to give the european union a common approach for its dealings with third countries in areas of food safety 
this is what we shall be trying to achieve during the portuguese presidency and we hope at the end of it to be able to present the result of our efforts to this house 
i thank the president-in-office for his reply 
i am sure that he is aware of the very serious threat to the european model which is based on family farming mainly those farmers involved in beef and sheepmeat production who are now expected to sell their produce at or below production costs 
i would like to ask what new steps the council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks in particular against the ranch and factory-style production of the usa and new zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for european farmers extremely difficult and where of course european standards of food safety do not apply 
i completely understand your concerns and i feel that there is a need for effort and a certain degree of consistency within the european union itself on this issue 
we also have to think of the consequences especially in terms of financing and compensating farmers 
nevertheless as you know this issue is now in the hands of the european commission and it will have to take this further 
the council of the european union is aware of the problems faced by the homeless of which as you know there are many causes ranging from drugs and violence against women and children to long-term unemployment 
it is an extreme manifestation of the phenomenon of social exclusion and of poverty which the council is attempting to combat in various ways 
in fact there are so many causes that there must be a greater variety of political initiatives to address these problems as well as further debate as there is in all of the areas in which the union intervenes and in line with all of the policies to be developed in this area 
the first area in which there must be political action is that of combating violence committed by men against women and children which often causes women to run away either with their children or alone which in turn may have serious consequences 
in order to combat these violence-related phenomena parliament and the council last december adopted the daphne programme which is an action programme designed to combat violence against women and children and which will shortly come into force 
this programme will support action carried out by ngos in this field 
at the beginning of may this year the portuguese presidency will be organising a conference in lisbon on violence against women 
with regard to combating drug addiction i would remind you of the programme for the prevention of drug addiction adopted in december by the european parliament and the council with the aim of promoting a multi-disciplinary approach which was to take particular account of the implications of this phenomenon for society and for individuals 
one part of this initiative specifically seeks to combat social exclusion 
it also seeks to encourage social inclusion by actively promoting concrete measures and greater coordination both of employment policies and of the whole raft of policies which could guarantee an increase in european competitiveness thereby increasing the development of our own economy 
this would have obvious consequences in terms of our ability to remedy all of these negative knock-on effects which cause social exclusion and which are obviously linked to poverty 
still on the subject of concrete measures for combating social exclusion we should remember that the european commission announced that it will be proposing a five-year action plan under article of the treaty which seeks to combat social exclusion 
this mr papayannakis and i would like to remind you of my own participation in the last intergovernmental conference was an issue that brought some european countries together during that conference 
we also achieved if i may say so the feat of bringing it into the scope of the revised treaty of amsterdam 
i think that this is an issue which we should always bear in mind 
it is therefore a key issue which will enable us to show the public how useful europe can be to them 
if we do not do this we will find it difficult to persuade them to take an interest in a greater europe 
however this is a problem which will outlive the six months of the portuguese presidency 
we will do what we can in these six months 
mr president i too would like to welcome the president-in-office to the chamber 
but i do not think he answered my question with regard specifically to tackling homelessness and housing and whether the portuguese presidency would be willing to meet the non-governmental organisations actively involved in this field 
i appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency 
my specific question concerns the problem of homelessness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties the president-in-office alluded to with regard to support at intergovernmental level 
i feel this is one area where europe can play a very active role even if only in providing the conduit for exchange of experience and best practice among the member states 
we have worked closely with portuguese ngos and with some initiatives they have proposed within the framework of the portuguese presidency which we are combining with the wide range of concerns underpinning our whole programme 
we have no specific concrete initiatives in this area but that does not mean that we are closed to the idea that an initiative proposed to us by ngos in this area might be considered during our presidency 
mr president-in-office of the council you have talked a lot about the future about what the commission will do and what the presidency will do in lisbon etc 
however you also said something which i find particularly frightening 
you said that in lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development 
i am beginning to feel a little worried because this may lead partially at least to exclusion 
i do not see how you could with the views that you hold provide any answers 
what i asked and what i am once again asking is the following what are the views of the portuguese presidency on for example the appeals made by the network to combat poverty and exclusion the division of work and social security the implementation of tax policies particularly for speculative capital and the policy of redistributing wealth 
i would like an answer as to whether or not the portuguese presidency intends to do something about these matters 
one of them is the series of measures which must be adopted immediately in order to deal with the specific effects of social exclusion 
the second is to create internationally competitive conditions which will enable us to improve the economic fabric of the european union and this will have positive knock-on effects on the problems of social exclusion 
the portuguese presidency does not have a magic wand with which it can in six months resolve problems that have always existed 
it is prepared to act on proposals by the commission in any area for which there is community competence 
it also has the opportunity and the desire to promote the whole raft of measures which may be presented specifically by non-governmental organisations but also through the intergovernmental collaboration which is traditional in these matters 
we should however also bear in mind mr papayannakis that we cannot act in an area which will have such a big financial impact armed only with the measures a presidency can propose in the space of six months 
we therefore think that all the measures we have highlighted in terms of long-term strategies regardless of the fact that we know that in the long term some of the homeless may be dead will help us to guarantee sustainable policies in the european union 
we will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency 
subject portuguese presidency and development policy will the president-in-office of the council make a statement on the priorities of the portuguese presidency with regard to development policy the convention of lomé and tackling famine situations 
mr president the issue of european development aid policy has over the last few years undergone a marked change 
i am thinking in particular of the whole debate in which we participated on renewing the lomé convention and on establishing the new contractual framework which will succeed the lomé convention 
i think and i say this with the authority of someone who has been involved in the negotiations both on portugal joining lomé iii and in the negotiations on lomé iv as president of the portuguese delegation that these issues today are very confusing for the general public and especially for governments and i think that they must be also confusing for members of this house 
how can we judge the real effectiveness of appropriations allocated to development aid in combating the negative factors they are supposed to address 
why should we do this 
because our own national parliaments are concerned just as this parliament needs to be at community level about the way in which these appropriations are being allocated and used 
we are anxious to guarantee that these discussions are useful and productive and that they yield concrete results chiefly as regards future action at international level 
we also think that the new contractual model defined for the lomé convention is a more responsible balanced and efficient model than the one operating under the previous yaoundé and lomé conventions 
mr president ladies and gentlemen i would also like to say as a summit between the european union and african countries may yet take place that these development cooperation issues and a general understanding of how development issues might be addressed in the framework of a bilateral relationship between these two zones will of course be paramount in our concerns 
it will also be one of the central themes of this agenda 
i would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question and indeed the minister who spoke to the committee on development last week in brussels outlining the position 
but there are some questions still outstanding 
there does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against aids in the programme 
the situation of aids in africa now is so serious that more people are dying of aids than are dying in conflict 
i hope that the minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue 
medicines are available in the united states but the united states is not making them cheap enough for the people in africa 
i should like to ask the minister what precisely he is doing about the situation that is developing in ethiopia where there is drought where the crops have failed and where in six months' time we will inevitably be back to the situation as it was some years ago in ethiopia with famine and people dying in their thousands 
at the same time there is a war going on between eritrea and ethiopia and the armaments industry in europe is not short in sending guns after which we will send the bread 
there is no contradiction between our two positions quite the opposite 
unless we wish to act like megalomaniacs we cannot in the course of one presidency perform an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginary situations relating to all the enormous issues we face particularly in the area of external relations 
as you can understand it would be easy to do so 
all we would have to do is get a directory of development and put all the items in our programme one after the other 
we are sufficiently responsible to realise that we should only include those which we will be able to manage during the term of our presidency and we should always be aware of this within governments' ability to act and within the scope of the council 
we must understand that there are limitations on what we can achieve particularly in terms of managing national indicative programmes 
you have mentioned ethiopia which falls within the scope of national indicative programmes but there are as you know several community actions to combat aids and in this respect you are right and the united states will probably not do any better 
indeed in terms of development aid policy i think that europe has absolutely nothing to worry about for the simple reason that our behaviour in this area compares very favourably with that of the united states 
your question switched to the subject of arms a broader policy issue which i do not think falls within the scope of this question but which the council will of course address in the future if it sees fit and if it decides to put it in a specific context 
is the council aware of the social problems caused by the export of food by the eu to developing countries at prices below the cost of production 
does the presidency intend to do anything about this 
you have raised a long-standing problem in the field of food aid which is whether food aid might actually be damaging agriculture in developing countries 
this is an issue which arises time and time again and for which within the framework of development aid no answer has ever been found 
it is traditionally raised because in practice actions linked to food aid are often thought to have a negative impact on the establishment of agricultural structures in these countries specifically in terms of family-based farming 
i have no solutions for this and in my experience of more than twenty years of dealing with these issues i do not think that anyone else has either 
since the author is not present question no lapses 
i think that these factors have played a role in the various positions adopted by the union in its external relations 
an example of this is the way we have conveyed our concerns within the world trade organisation 
nor does the council underestimate the importance of culture and sport in economic terms 
as this is the case i would like to point out mr marinos that if the cultural dimension of european policy is to deserve the attention of the competent authorities this will have to be done with due regard to the principle of subsidiarity taking into account what has to be done at national level as well as at community level 
however we shall be conducting our presidency with a european perspective 
i think that the lisbon european council and the initiative to which i referred earlier meet this requirement perfectly 
i believe mr president that the issues you have put to me are connected with the questions by mr bushill-matthews and mr nogueira román 
on the subject of the forthcoming intergovernmental conference i would like to say that the council can only refer you gentlemen to the conclusions of the cologne and helsinki european councils which defined the mandates for this conference 
it should therefore continue to be the responsibility of the conference itself which is an intergovernmental structure to study how the issues you have raised could be incorporated into its work within the scope of its mandate 
the president of the european parliament will also have an opportunity to make progress in this area at ministerial level 
with regard to the rotating presidency this is not an issue which the portuguese presidency intends to raise on its own initiative at the next intergovernmental conference 
however if anyone does wish to address this issue we shall take account of that and we shall table it for the conference 
i would like to thank the president-in-office of the council and i would personally like to welcome him and the portuguese presidency 
please allow me to remark on how well-versed and well-informed he is on european affairs 
unfortunately in my case he did not provide what i would call a satisfactory answer 
since the council recognises the fact that culture is a major economic asset it should in my view demonstrate this in practice 
saying that the cultural dimension is governed by the principle of subsidiarity and that it is therefore national governments who are responsible is i am afraid just an excuse 
my question which has not been answered is why when the european parliament is looking to increase appropriations to fund cultural programmes within the european union the council and the commission are cutting back on appropriations and at times cutting them out altogether 
i would therefore like to ask the council if it is prepared henceforth to support culture with the same readiness as it supported bananas hops cows and indian hemp 
mr marinos we are not adopting a purely economic approach to managing the portuguese presidency and therefore the cultural dimension is i am sure you will appreciate one of our main concerns 
these cultural dimensions however almost always have their own economic dimension in turn that is the level of resources which can be called on specifically to provide aid for cultural initiatives 
this is a dimension which it is difficult to go beyond within the framework of the european union and especially within the framework of the council 
this is and will continue to be connected with developments within the world trade organisation 
as you know both we and the council have addressed this issue appropriately 
in specific terms we have been able to find a common language in terms of the mandate given to the commission for the next round of wto negotiations at which this will be a central issue 
the presidency will also concentrate on discussions about creating a digital television system in europe which will be the subject of a conference that we shall be organising during the portuguese presidency in conjunction with the commission in february 
but mr marinos in the eu context culture is an issue which is repeatedly raised in connection with igc agendas 
if by chance it were possible to agree to include the cultural dimension in what has been called the fifth negotiating box of the forthcoming intergovernmental conference then this could be suggested both by member states and by the members of the european parliament taking part in the preparatory group 
of course if consensus could be reached on this issue at the intergovernmental conference there might eventually be progress 
it remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this 
we will soon see and for our part we will bear in mind any suggestions on this issue 
mr president i join others in wishing portugal every good wish for a successful presidency 
i notice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next igc but if some people wished it you would consider it 
well i and my fellow british conservative meps wish it and would like you to please consider it 
i appreciate that it is a provocative question 
it is meant to provoke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold eu law in the respect which it deserves 
we have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can reconnect with our citizens 
i cannot think of a better way to do it 
can you 
the issue is whether the european dimension will become stronger or weaker as a result of being specifically integrated into the treaties 
this is an issue which as you will understand will have to be addressed at igc level and is an issue that only a special european council can authorise the portuguese presidency to pursue because this kind of issue falls outside the institutional framework in which the forthcoming intergovernmental conference will take place 
intergovernmental conferences are a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of christmas tree 
it is therefore not out of the question that these issues which crop up again and again and which are passed from one conference to another may be addressed 
mr dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a procedural motion 
i would ask him to be brief 
mr president i understand that i have to do this very quickly 
i liked what mr seixas da costa said about father christmas 
in spain they say a letter to the three kings 
i simply wish to remind you that the european parliament has already sent a letter to the three kings through its reports 
now the presidency and the council have to bring the presents which we have asked them for in our letter to the three kings 
as i suspected it was not exactly a procedural motion but more a closing of the debate 
we thank mr seixas da costa but he can also write his letter to the three kings 
i would merely say that the festive issue which mr dimitrakopoulos has raised is an extremely important one 
the problem is that in this case father christmas has to follow orders and therefore he can only give presents when he is authorised by others to do so 
after this interesting exchange of opinions and in accordance with the rules of procedure i would like to tell you that questions nos to will be replied to in writing 
that concludes questions to the council 
madam president mr president-in-office of the council commissioner during the asian crisis in as with those which hit mexico in or the ems in everyone could see the damage caused to the economies of entire countries by financial speculation particularly currency speculation 
between eur and billion are traded every day on the financial markets 
in three or four days this can equal the total figure of annual global production or global gdp of approximately eur billion 
the bulk of these financial transactions are purely speculative and do not involve any trade in goods or investments 
yet the erratic movement of these massive sums of capital can in a few hours cause the collapse of a currency or the economy of a country plunging its whole population into recession 
in view of this situation renewed interest has been expressed in the proposal by james tobin winner of the nobel prize for economics to create a tax on currency transactions 
the rate of this would be very low so that it did not affect trade in goods or investments but it would act as a light brake on the wheels of speculation thereby checking the multiplication of short-term transactions 
note that this proposed tax which seems to be producing strong emotions in some people would be the lowest tax in the world and the lowest in the history of global taxation 
yet it would represent the recapture of the areas seized from democracy by the financial sphere 
one reason for the acceptance of this proposal and of the campaigns by ngos such as attac solidar or others which have popularised this proposal is that it would release resources which could be allocated to development programmes in the poorest countries in areas such as education or health 
it could act as a kind of asset redistribution in a world where there is both increasing wealth and increasing poverty 
many personalities and institutions have come out in favour of this tax such as the brazilian president fernando cardoso the finnish government the canadian parliament last march and also lionel jospin in 
this question has been debated in several national parliaments of the eu 
the common response has been that this tax could not be applied solely at national level and that the right platform for tackling this is the european union 
this is the reason for the oral question to the council and commission which we have tabled with other members 
this motion asks the commission to present a report to parliament within six months on the feasibility of this tax 
it also asks for an examination of the pressures and financial sanctions which could be applied against countries which encourage tax evasion or which maintain tax havens 
one of the most common objections is that such a tax would be too complex but this could be said of any tax 
if this argument had been accepted in the past then no taxes would ever have been created 
the motion also asks that a position document drawn up by the commission and council should be submitted before the next annual meeting of the imf 
the european union must take the initiative and must also as demanded in the motion propose this initiative to the because it is primarily a political question 
if the union takes the initiative this will have a ratchet effect because this debate is occurring all over the world including in the usa and japan 
a desire is being expressed everywhere with increasing force that the world should not be ruled by traders but by the people their parliaments their governments and their democratic institutions 
europe must play a role in this new international regulation and i am extremely happy that today with this debate and this motion this question is now on the agenda of european construction 
madam president i do not have a great deal to add on this subject 
the council has not yet discussed the possibility of introducing a tax on movements of capital as professor tobin suggested 
this is a creative initiative which we know has been welcomed by different industries across the world and by various sides in european politics but the commission has not yet put forward any proposal or initiative on this issue 
as it falls to the commission to propose any such initiative the council has not yet been able to adopt a position on this issue 
madam president the revenue basis of the tobin tax is said to be made up of very short-term exchange transactions 
such transactions according to the argument bear very little relation to fundamental economic variables 
this has also just been underlined by mr désir 
therefore according to proponents such as mr désir an internationally applied tobin tax would in principle reduce speculative transactions and hence the volatility of exchange rates which would lead to an improvement in economic prosperity 
taking into account the considerable volume of short-term financial streams even a low nominal tobin tax would yield respectable sums of tax revenue 
in reality the motive underlying the increased interest in the tobin tax and other sources of international finance in the mid-nineties was non-economic 
indeed it was fuelled by the potential of this tax to generate income for international public programmes at a time when demand for such funds was rising quickly and funding was increasingly harder to come by 
the commission recently observed renewed interest in a global tax such as the tobin tax as a means of achieving socially responsible globalisation so to speak 
mr désir too has mentioned this growing interest on all sides 
but if the tobin tax were to be applied unilaterally in order to prevent attacks on a specific currency then this tax could not be effective and it could harm the internal financial market 
put more strongly in the long term it is possible that for large numbers of funds the tobin tax will be evaded by shifting foreign exchange rate transactions to off-shore tax havens 
in that case the tax could lead to a net loss of total economic prosperity 
so the tobin tax can only be effective if there is a sufficient number of industrialised countries which are prepared to participate 
finally even if the tobin tax is designed to curb speculations with currencies there is still the risk that even non-speculative streams would be affected and that is not the intention 
for the reasons set out above i cannot see a good reason for introducing a european tobin tax 
at any rate the commission is against any attempt to restrict capital movement within the european union 
in more direct terms to the extent that this measure could be deemed an indirect restriction on capital streams this would contravene the treaty of rome 
the correct speculative approach it seems to me is to remove the real causes which lead to financial chaos rather than attempting to suppress its symptoms by introducing obstacles to the operation of the markets 
madam president commissioner i should like once again to say a few words on the modus operandi and the ideological tactics behind this oral question 
also because i know how many social democrats in this house share our criticism and not just the economic and financial policy experts 
we know what the problem is instability on the markets as the result of speculation 
but the people asking the question need to know that not every instance of instability as the commissioner has just so impressively told us is the result of speculation 
the tobin tax would not have been able to prevent the crises in the eea in and or the crises in the south-east asian currencies in 
in my view and i say this quite clearly the question is ideologically motivated rather than solution-focused 
i consider this to be the wrong way forward for several reasons 
why do we reject the tobin tax and consider it so questionable 
first and the commissioner has also confirmed this because it places a heavy burden on the capital markets 
even a small tax would have serious repercussions on the capital markets because this sort of speculation tax would reduce the profitability of investments considerably 
in addition this sort of measure would also seriously hamper the development of the financial markets and would stand in the way of the principle of the free movement of capital which is one of the central tenets of the internal market 
secondly speculative capital is extremely difficult to identify 
thirdly unless they are introduced in all countries at the same time tax measures are easy to circumvent because there are otherwise too many loopholes 
fourthly technically speaking this measure is highly impracticable and will result in a great deal of bureaucracy and administration and be impossible to control 
the measure which we should be taking is part of the resolution before us here today 
we need stronger banking supervision 
we need to clarify the liability for transactions 
we need a framework of regulations at international level 
we need to examine national laws in order to check that they comply with the rules of the basle committee and how the dissemination of these rules can be stepped up 
i have a serious problem with one of the central points of this resolution which we cannot accept as it stands 
i refer to point 
the capital markets do not want uncertainty from us they want clarity which is why we reject point and call for a split vote 
madam president the debate on a tax on short-term financial actions is not a new one 
we have been discussing the tobin tax proposal for twenty years and yet the question is still topical because we need really concrete and honest answers based on careful studies 
we need to know just how desirable and feasible a tax on short-term transactions really is 
this question has now entered a different dimension a dimension in which usd billion roam the world twenty-four hours a day looking for attractive investments no more than % of which have anything to do with the real economy 
we are concerned about stability on the financial markets not for the sake of the financial markets but because this has to do with own growth our own investments and our own jobs in the european union 
we must ask what instruments we can use in order to create the order here which has been missing in the past 
we have done everything to help liberalise financial transactions but so far we have had no working set of rules as we have learned from the bitter lessons of the repercussions of the asian and latin american crises 
it is therefore high time that we thought both about supervisory regulations and about transparency on the financial markets and their information 
it is important that we know who the actors are and what their credit rating is 
we must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice 
at a time when the tax burden on the work factor is increasing throughout europe and internationally we must consider how we can achieve efficient taxation of investment income and that includes the question of how to tax short-term financial transactions 
i think that we really do need a careful report and conclusions from the commission so that we as the european parliament can see if we need to ensure that the european union achieves real international solidarity with the usa and japan in making the economy and the financial markets more stable and secure 
this is the intention behind the question and we must then follow the ordinary procedures of reports from committees and plenary debate in order to reach a balanced and really forward-looking proposal 
madam president on behalf of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party i must express my surprise at this debate on the international movement of capital and its possible taxation which although it does not mention it in the text appears to be an attempt to revive as the introduction has done the issue of the tax proposed some years ago by mr tobin which our group opposed clearly and totally during the last legislature with a series of arguments clearly and coherently expressed by our president mr cox 
i will have to repeat these arguments modestly in this intervention because the same issue has arisen once again 
we do not agree with this type of tax because its application in the event that it could happen would not achieve the aims which mr tobin presented at the time and which the left in this house wishes to revive 
firstly there is no evidence that the tax on international capital movements could reduce the dangers of volatility and instability in the international markets 
on the contrary since it is certain that not all countries would accept it we would open the way to speculation and fraud and that really would create volatility instability insecurity opacity and unfair competition in the field of financial services operating on an international level 
furthermore the idea of obtaining resources to apply them to the more economically needy countries presents such complexity when we consider their application in practice that it appears simply impossible 
this is a false debate whose aim is purely political and has no basis or technical viability 
furthermore since we are in this european parliament if we have still not managed the slightest agreement with regard to the package of fiscal measures proposed by the commission within the european union how can we expect to achieve a fiscal agreement on an international level 
however the liberal group has not wanted to close the door to a new analysis of this issue and therefore we have accepted a joint motion for a resolution proposing that a study be carried out on the possibility and suitability of imposing this tax on certain areas of international capital movements 
i am sure that this study if carried out objectively with knowledge of the financial markets and their mechanisms on an international level will show that it is neither suitable nor possible not only in terms of its application but also as a means of achieving the proposed objectives 
in itself globalisation is positive 
the economy has never grown so much nor favoured so many countries on a global level 
this is due to progressive opening up and greater freedom in the international trade in goods and services and also a greater capacity for adequate movement of capital 
any analysis of economic development in recent years if objective will show through the figures that they have no political colour or orientation 
as i have said we are not opposed to such a study 
we will support the motion for a resolution in support of this study but we simply insist that as this motion for a resolution points out it is by means of liberalisation and opening up at an international level that we will achieve economic progress both on the level of states and on a general level 
madam president commissioner the problem does not lie in the ideology of the debate but in its political nature 
as mrs randzio-plath said we must remember that the reason why certain members want to revive this question is because of the recent international financial crises and their economic social and environmental consequences which have been felt by all in some countries 
the main objective of this debate is to look at the instruments available to the international community for stabilising the international financial and monetary system 
in this respect mr bolkestein the motion for a resolution cannot be separated from the issue of the tobin tax 
if you look carefully this proposed tax on capital is just one of several instruments aimed at forcing international investors to behave responsibly on the financial markets 
secondly the motion does not say that we want a solely european initiative 
this is why we explicitly refer to the autumn session of the international monetary fund so that the european union in other words the commission and also the council can decide how it will defend the opportunity to stabilise the international financial and monetary system and introduce international taxation 
there should be no confusion in this debate 
as environmentalists we do not want an excuse for a motion 
although a study produced by the commission would doubtless be interesting we do not need another to add to those already available 
we do need to obtain from the commission and the council in other words from each of the governments forming the union a clear positive or negative political stance 
they must indicate whether they are ready to defend within competent public bodies such as the international monetary fund in the first instance the appropriateness of such a tax within the other instruments needed to stabilise the international monetary system 
as for the argument that this initiative would increase uncertainty very short-term capital movements are specifically intended to play on uncertainty and to bet on changes between currencies or various short-term financial assets 
this argument is therefore not relevant 
i will not go into the basic issue any further for everyone has their arguments 
however i would highlight not only paragraph of the motion but also paragraph 
we clearly expect a political stance to be taken with a very firm deadline of the preparations for the autumn session of the international monetary fund 
we therefore demand if this motion is adopted tomorrow that the commission and council appear before parliament to tell us what positions they will take on this occasion 
madam president my group is extremely delighted that this debate is taking place today particularly as we have spared no effort along with members of other groups to bring this about 
obviously we all have different approaches which is demonstrated by our debate and the motions for a resolution tabled at the beginning 
having said this our group is pleased about the step forward which the compromise motion represents 
this invites the commission to present a report within six months 
the european parliament can play its role by taking the initiative even if it does so timidly on this subject 
however i agree with the previous speaker that if paragraph were challenged this motion would clearly lose its substance 
this debate concerns a vital question which increasing numbers of people are legitimately raising 
this represents over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in goods and services 
by putting finance at the helm this has reinforced the demands of profitability and toughened the operating conditions everywhere 
it has led to a growth in mergers acquisitions and company restructuring and to gigantic sums being raised with increasing frequency on the financial markets 
unemployment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing 
openings and real growth are being hampered and the sudden influx or withdrawal of speculative capital is threatening the economies of many countries to the point of collapse as in asia russia and brazil 
faced with this neoliberal globalisation dominated by the financial markets demand as our motion recognises is developing from a different idea of the world in which common law stipulates a duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world 
no one can ignore the challenge to civilisation posed by the lack of nearly one billion jobs and the need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to information 
in this respect all ideas deserve to be considered including the tobin tax which is important just like other forms of transaction which may be envisaged 
this tax could help to check speculation without penalising the activities of the real economy 
it could release new resources for investment in people and at a time when the undp estimates the sum needed to eradicate poverty to be usd billion per year it could allow access for everyone to drinking water and satisfy health needs 
when the debate on the ability of politics to influence economics goes global the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political desire to recapture the democratic areas seized by the international financial operators 
the commissioner has said that a minimum number of industrialised countries would be needed to achieve this 
i would point out that the european union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and like mr désir and several other speakers i feel that the european union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect 
in any case the european parliament would be honoured to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well-being for everyone 
madam president i too am delighted that we are having this debate 
i only regret that it has been so long in coming 
we know that each generation has over the course of time blindly bought into what could be called a dominant ideology 
this is a set of prejudices accepted as such due to a general conformism but whose dramatic nature can be seen by subsequent generations 
free trade and the constant worship of globalisation are now the dominant ideology or rather the big mistake of our fin de siècle 
this ideology is as dangerous as the former ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the corridors of the kremlin or before that the certainty elevated to the status of a dogma that the earth was flat 
our world is now dominated by a single logic or i could say a single god of money at work instead of people at work 
with a figure for trade in goods and services of frf billion only being equal to the product of four days' speculation the financial bubble owes very little to the productive activity of individuals 
it is self-perpetuating in a world of ever higher bids which constantly denies the humanity of man the rich as much as the poor 
it was natural that these élites would exclude any political concerns from their field of manoeuvre thus protecting themselves from any democratic control and basically managing to be both illegitimate and irresponsible 
however the people are fighting back as demonstrated by their reaction during the incredible seattle summit 
the leaders of the world headed unfortunately by the european commission rushed forward submissively hoping that their docility at the feet of the master of the world mr clinton would be enough to ensure them the scraps from the table 
yet they reckoned without the salutary reaction of the nobodies both individuals and states 
this reaction was more organised than previously due in france particularly to the magnificent attac network which is fighting with increasing support to limit free trade in general and to establish taxation of international financial transactions in particular 
the creation of this taxation of either the tobin type or the more realistic type proposed by professor lauré could prove to be politically opportune at least due to its symbolism rather than its low rate 
this is because it would basically mean that politics was regaining a foothold in an area from which it has been excluded by operators whose profits are proportional to the degree of resignation of states 
madam president although some of the aims of the tobin tax are fairly worthy of support introducing the tax exclusively within the territory of the european union as the first area of the world to do so would sound the death knell for the european currency markets 
this has already been made clear a number times in this debate 
there should therefore be a universal application it is not enough that the countries or the other industrialised countries are involved 
on the other hand it would be so difficult to bring the scheme into force everywhere in the world at precisely the same time and personally speaking i do not believe we can achieve this that the tobin tax dream might as well be buried 
furthermore although there might be international consensus on the introduction of the scheme the question would remain regarding how the tax revenue would be distributed 
with regard to the tobin tax as a means of preventing future currency crises it has to be realised that the causes of a currency being overvalued cannot be averted through taxation 
for that reason as mr karas also said we should give more attention to the policies that lead to a certain currency being overvalued in relation to its actual potential value 
this again would require measures to regulate the exportation and importation of capital otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policies in this way 
although it seems a reasonable scheme the tobin tax is not without its problems even if there should be agreement as to its implementation which i do not believe there will 
it has to be remembered that money at present is first and foremost information and that the global economy will in the future rotate more and more on the basis of information and intellectual capital 
hence as mr karas has stated to his credit our group is resolutely opposed to the introduction of the tobin tax 
madam president i speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders 
it seems to me blindingly self-evident that some action is necessary 
in the last years the volume of currency transactions has increased by times firstly total global reserves of all central banks barely amounts to one day of foreign exchange trading secondly annual global trade in real goods and services equals just three-and-a-half days of foreign exchange markets out of that is % of capital movements are for trade in goods and services and % are for speculation 
the size unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange markets have made it harder and harder to manage national and regional economies 
computer-controlled selling programmes turned a random blip into an avalanche burying jobs lives and industries across the globe 
the only arguments against it are firstly it would impair the efficiency of the foreign exchange market a little fanciful in light of the financial feeding frenzies we have seen that have destroyed jobs throughout the world in east asia europe and latin america 
mr chirac has described those who engage in this as the aids virus of the world economy 
what is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators stockbrokers and option traders 
of course this cannot be done in one country it cannot be done within the single currency area but it could be done at international level with global cooperation 
europe japan and the us the euro the yen and the dollar would constitute in my opinion such a block 
i am disappointed in the epp 
i thought at least they read the resolutions they were going to vote on 
yes i am in favour of such a tax but it is not what we are going to vote on tomorrow 
what we are going to vote on tomorrow is to ask the commission to study the matter to look at what steps and what conditions would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax 
equally i understand the commissioner failing to endorse such a tax but i cannot understand why he failed to have the courage to welcome the opportunity to demonstrate the truth of his position by a study of the issue 
there is nothing so closed as a closed mind 
the tax has the support of % of the people in the uk according to a recent survey by war on want 
in france it has had enormous resonance particularly when linked to a demand to use the proceeds to help the third world out of its debt and poverty 
this issue can no longer be ignored by parliament the council or the commission 
there is now a weight of public opinion demanding an answer more sophisticated than it has not been done before 
in the new millennium with new global problems requiring new global solutions they need to give good arguments why it cannot be done now rather than why it has not been done in the past 
madam president commissioner a compromise resolution on the usefulness of a tax on international financial flows would constitute a first step towards the essential amendment of many international rules 
i have two or three points to make in this respect 
one of the main demands of the demonstrators in seattle was rightly the establishment of this type of tax and this is not by chance 
the proposal of this tax today sends out a strong signal from the rich european countries proving that they want to move away from the culture of egoism 
everyone feels that this kind of joint tax is a virtuous measure which does not prevent trade but is aimed primarily at speculation and its perverse effects 
the members on the right should note this 
it symbolises the need for solidarity with the countries of the south particularly those in africa the caribbean and the pacific which questioned us extensively on this subject in seattle 
in order to fully achieve its objective the money supply released by such a tax must be redistributed among the poorest countries 
this is how we can give sense and morality to the commercial rules and show solidarity with the people of the south 
madam president we cannot just keep repeating the number which several previous speakers have quoted we must also mention the fact commissioner that % of these huge daily foreign exchange sales have an investment term of no more than eight days 
we cannot maintain a situation in which investments and the creation of jobs are less lucrative than short-term sales of foreign currency and shares 
we cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action 
we cannot maintain a situation in which income from non-economic activities increases more and more quickly 
it has been demonstrated in germany that income from monetary assets has almost doubled from % of overall economic income since tobin developed his idea 
we cannot maintain a situation in which the poorest countries of the world are most exposed to the speculative arguments surrounding short-term currency fluctuations 
nor do i believe that this is impracticable 
why should it not be possible for the countries the other eu member states china singapore and switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the tobin tax 
there must be an overriding economic interest 
why should it be impracticable and it can be differentiated to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions all the so-called cash transactions currency futures and options 
why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardise the long-term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short-term and speculative investments unattractive 
numerous very difficult questions are bound to arise but the only real problem which i can see so far is one of political will and the st. florian principle of shifting responsibility from one agency to another which has now taken hold 
madam president we are not asking for more bureaucracy as mr karas put it just a few minutes ago 
we are looking for solutions 
of course capital markets need clarity that is actually the idea 
the tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question 
the more progress is made towards trade liberalisation the more rules are needed as commissioner lamy said during the millennium round in seattle 
he recognised that the combined impact of the single market and the single currency that characterise the process of the european union's construction is intimately linked to a huge amount of new regulations 
now that financing is readily available across national boundaries without any difficulty the same approach will obviously be strictly necessary all the more so as we consider that an enormous amount every single day is employed in speculative transactions 
we citizens of the world cannot afford the current rate of speculation 
to continue would be economic suicide 
honourable members commissioner it is often said that europe has succeeded in stabilising the economic sector but this is only true if we confine ourselves purely to the public sector 
the debt burdens of the private sector and the corresponding excessive inflation of stock exchange securities the two main market stability indicators have for some time been at danger levels as the commission report on the economic situation in europe clearly illustrates 
the fact that the public accepts such rates and does not just abandon all financial activities in a panic can be explained by overambitious expectations over future gains 
speculative activities are growing beyond measure and are in turn generating profits which will eventually prove to be merely fictitious 
over-optimism will give way to disappointment and fear which in turn will result in a stock market and economic crisis 
the danger is too great for us to ignore 
we ought to face it regardless of how difficult it may seem 
modern economic science has provided an exceptional instrument with the tobin proposal and others which we will be able to use if we have the political will to make a start 
that is what we are lacking commissioner the political will to make a start in tackling speculation 
no longer should there be a place in democracy for the worship of or for this fatalist approach towards market forces as adopted by the liberals and i am sorry that mr gasòliba i böhm has left as this will only lead to its ruin 
madam president mr bolkestein the ignorance surrounding this debate is unbelievable 
we needed a greek member to finally tell us what this tobin tax means 
you reject it flatly because you do not understand the first thing about it 
that the right opposes taxes is quite understandable except that they should never have been allowed to spirit their millions or rather billions into switzerland 
we all know that 
but now i call on you in all consciousness to help put a stop to speculative financial transactions and undermining long-term projects with long-term capital 
they are all tarred with the same dirty brush 
we need a tobin tax to give us a fiscal instrument with which we can intervene 
madam president i am totally appalled by the commission' s i.e mr bolkestein' s political ignorance 
he should perhaps use his position on the tobin tax to ask himself why he is here at all 
madam president i too have found parts of the debate quite bizarre 
it is perhaps not by chance that the conservative benches have emptied because that which is represented as market freedom no longer has anything in common with the noble principles of the social market economy which has brought so much prosperity to us here in western europe over recent decades 
if we continue down this path and this is the ideology and declare the financial markets to be sacrosanct and even claim that any intervention in the workings of these markets is contrary to progress and contrary to the growth of the economy then we will quite certainly be on the wrong tack and that could take on quite dangerous proportions 
those who own the monetary assets are currently amassing huge fortunes which are again screaming out to be reinvested 
we have asset inflation of global proportions 
as a result speculative bubbles continually arise on the financial markets causing growing economic instability which in turn jeopardises the entire economy 
and it is precisely the medium-sized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result 
we can take action against this it is possible 
the minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last not only by the commission but by reputable economic institutes throughout europe 
that too is feasible 
and then perhaps everyone will stop bandying about arguments which are asking for trouble 
it is not correct that the tobin tax is technically impracticable it is quite feasible in the age of the computer 
the fact that tax havens are frequently nothing but hard disk storage space for large european banks here at home must not be ignored 
in short we must not allow real capital and speculative capital to become so remote from each other because otherwise we shall be steering towards situations which we experienced on this continent time and again during the last century and which had catastrophic results 
madam president let us indeed tax money speculation it does not produce anything new 
the tax would be targeted at the right place at the speculators 
who is going to defend these speculators when nurses and teachers are paying top rates of tax 
article c of the treaty establishing the european union provides scope for taxation on transactions 
those who oppose taxation on currency dealing are in favour of those tax-recycling centres the tax havens of which there are in all 
the union should make a tax pact which any countries could initially be party to 
the low rate tobin tax would not cause tax-recycling problems 
it is strange to claim that if everyone is not included it would be impossible to bring into effect 
the european union was founded through the efforts of just a few countries and you see how we are today 
the truth is the greatest problem is a political one they do not want to tax capital but raise personal taxation instead 
in the end tax would politicise the global undemocratic system of financial power 
madam president may i begin by extending a heartfelt thanks to all speakers and above all of course mr désir for the fact that this debate is taking place this evening 
whatever one may think about the topic of debate it is evident that it is an important one 
this is why it has been around for years and it is satisfying that the commission is being afforded the opportunity this evening to give a response 
i would like to start by underlining two remarks made by the member of your parliament mr gasòliba 
he said that globalisation is a positive phenomenon and i share his view 
i believe that globalisation has helped many countries which so far have been on the sideline of the world trade streams to participate in these and be incorporated into the world trade system and as far as i am aware no country has ever been worse off by participating in international trade 
in other words as indeed already remarked by mr gasòliba globalisation is in my view positive and i am of the opinion that it has contributed to a new international distribution of labour which has been pursued by many people for many years 
a second remark made by mr gasòliba was that there is currently no evidence that the tobin tax will stabilise the exchange rates 
i think that he is correct in this regard 
i too am not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transactions would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rates 
i am of the opinion that these are two important remarks and that is why i am reiterating them here 
madam president could i furthermore point out that none of the speakers this evening has drawn a link between the tobin tax on the one hand and the functioning of the european union on the other 
surely we are all familiar with the treaty of rome and know that one of the four freedoms is the freedom of capital movement 
madam president i can assure your parliament that my day-to-day work consists partly of attempting in conjunction with my offices and colleagues to completely integrate the financial markets within europe thus enabling financial transactions to run as easily and smoothly as possible 
in my capacity as commissioner for the internal market i am in other words opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions 
you could hardly expect this commissioner to agree with a tax which would in fact impede international economic movement 
once again the tobin tax is in my view at odds with the treaty of rome and this is an important theoretical objection which has not been considered by any of the speakers this evening 
madam president apart from these to my mind quite fundamental observations there are also practical objections to the tobin tax as already underlined by mr karas and other speakers 
it has unfortunately been observed i have to say that the european union has failed to reach agreement internally on specific tax measures 
this indicates how difficult these dossiers are 
if we have not been able to reach agreement internally i wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners 
i think that this will be problematic 
madam president mr jonckheer has stated that this could be one of the measures for stabilising the financial markets 
i think however that instability is merely a symptom and that we should be looking at the underlying causes 
i think that it is preferable to fight the causes rather than attempt to tackle the symptoms when this is probably not possible and when as already stated the measure concerned is pretty certainly at odds with the treaty of rome 
in order to remove these causes one has to look at what is happening in the countries in question 
is it the case that there is low inflation and that there are low interest rates 
that the markets for production factors including the labour market operate flexibly 
that is not always the case 
so if we want to look into what causes exchange rate instability then we need to take into account the elements of good governance and focus on these first 
in addition and this has also been mentioned already for example by mr gasòliba i böhm but also by others there is a need for more supervision 
more supervision nationally supervision by national governments of national banks and internationally for example by means of the imf 
so i believe the best way to tackle the causes is by ensuring on the one hand that good governance is observed in the countries in question and that on the other hand there is more supervision nationally and internationally in order to avoid these lapses 
madam president according to various members of your parliament more funding should still be made available for major projects 
my reply to this is that firstly countries should honour their pledges namely make % of their gross national product available for development aid and cooperation so that a great deal more money becomes available than at present for such long-term projects and via a route established for the purpose namely contributions to development cooperation and not via an artificial and probably harmful route namely the tobin tax 
madam president i should like to leave it here 
as far as the resolution is concerned of which i have seen a draft the commission will await the vote and will based on this determine its stance 
i thank you for giving me the opportunity to take part in this debate 
madam president unfortunately i do not have your mastery of the french language 
but i would be obliged if mr bolkestein would just listen for a minute which i think he cannot do at the same time as talking to mrs randzio-plath 
could you please draw his attention to the fact that i have something to say to him 
monsieur bolkestein je veux vous dire quelque chose 
unfortunately my dutch is not as good as yours 
but i would rather like to say something else to you 
parliament is not taking the initiative and supporting a tobin type tax just to annoy the commission 
we want to examine the possibility of introducing a tobin tax 
it will be just one of several instruments and hopefully you will be on our side in this 
from a political point of view i always fret when people say we neither need want nor can we achieve these things 
it is not your job it is our job to decide on that 
it also has something to do with the newly awoken self-consciousness of this parliament 
i just want to discuss it with you no more and no less 
we can do so without going off at other tangents 
i respect you as a serious commissioner who wants to take his work seriously 
please respect us as members of parliament who want to take our work seriously and that includes the tobin tax 
madam president an omission appears to have been made 
mr désir i note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution 
if the services of the presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled it will be included 
the debate is closed 
the vote will take place on thursday at p.m 
mr president i simply wanted to pass on some news 
there was a terrorist attack this morning in madrid 
someone planted a car bomb and one person has died 
on behalf of my group i once again condemn these terrorist acts 
thank you mrs fraga estévez 
we had heard about this regrettable incident 
unfortunately the terrorist murderers are once again punishing spanish society 
i note your comments with particular keenness as you may expect given that i too am spanish 
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on friday january 
madam president allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the cermis tragedy 
two years ago in cavalese in italy an american aeroplane from the aviano nato base cut through the cables of a cable car during a low-flying exercise which exceeded safe limits causing the deaths of more than europeans 
since then the victims' families who have not had the consolation of justice since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges have been awaiting solicitous financial compensation from the united states at the very least 
i therefore appeal to the president of this house and the president of the commission for them to stand surety for immediate compensation from the u.s. authorities and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims' families 
mrs angelilli thank you 
i have taken note of your comment 
the next item is the order of business 
if you decide to add this debate to the agenda it will be introduced by speeches from mr seixas da costa president-in-office of the council and mr romano prodi president of the commission 
is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal 
madam president it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with rule of our rules of procedure 
this debate is topical exceptionally important and urgent 
we therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it 
is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal 
madam president i shall speak against this proposal on the grounds of a principle which i consider absolutely vital with regard to observance of the treaties and with particular regard to article of the treaty of amsterdam 
madam president until now we believed that the european union was according to the treaty of rome and the treaty of paris founding the european communities and subsequently the union an association of free independent sovereign states 
even though many developments cast doubt on this we did believe in spite of everything that this was the case and more recently reference was made albeit half-heartedly to the principle of subsidiarity 
well patently if we do open this debate today madam president as you are requesting and as the conference of presidents is requesting on the basis of rule we shall then be opening up a fearsome breach in the principle of the freedom and sovereignty of the national states and the free constitution of democratically elected governments enabling some other majority in this parliament at some future time to claim the right to interfere in the formation of a government even though it has assumed power on the basis of free regular peaceful and democratic elections within a member state 
if you ratify 
mr gollnisch excuse me you have one minute 
i know that you always take particular care to ensure that the rules of procedure are observed 
madam president i thought i had three minutes 
do forgive me 
if you ratify this development then you are ratifying the development of the union into a body which violates the sovereignty and the freedom of the member states and we should then have no option but to withdraw from such a union 
we have heard one speaker in favour and one against 
i shall now therefore put this proposal for an amendment to the agenda to the vote 
this debate is therefore added at the top of the order of business 
the next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance 
the next item is the debate on the talks in austria on forming a government 
i shall immediately give the floor to mr seixas da costa president-in-office of the council 
first of all i would like to make it clear that the statement made by the portuguese prime minister on january on behalf of three other countries which are also member states of the european union was made in this specific context 
in other words a common political position was adopted by the heads of state and government of fourteen countries which portugal presented on behalf of all of them 
let me remind you of what this statement said 
the governments of the fourteen member states shall not initiate or accept any official bilateral contacts at political level with an austrian government which includes the freedom party 
austrian candidates for posts in international organisations will not have the support of these fourteen countries 
i think that over the last few days the reasons which have led the fourteen states supporting this statement to adopt it have become clear 
basically the view these states share of the political situation in austria led them to conclude that the possible inclusion in the austrian government of a party such as the freedom party could bring about a change in respect for the common values which the member states of the european union are committed to safeguarding 
we are all aware of the public statements made by jörg haider and of some of the ideas on specific policies that his party has advocated 
i do not think that i need to remind you about his ideas exonerating the nazi regime his attitudes towards foreign and immigrant communities or to point out that this populist nationalism is reminiscent of another era 
first of all madam president ladies and gentlemen no one is threatening the existence of a democratic government in austria or questioning the electoral reality behind the results of the recent elections 
what we regret and take issue with is the fact that the solution opted for gives a share of political power in that country to a party whose leaders have not given the slightest guarantee that they will safeguard the fundamental principles austria has committed itself to respect defend and promote 
today this applies to austria but tomorrow it could apply to any other country in the european union 
let me repeat that point this applies to austria today and it would apply tomorrow to any member state of the european union 
on the other hand as we all know human rights fundamental rights issues the great principles of democracy and of the rule of law the rules for protecting minorities and combating racism xenophobia and intolerance are no longer issues to be discussed purely within a country 
all the more so when that country belongs to a community of states for which these concerns represent the very heart of its project for civilisation 
the europe that we want to build and strengthen is not a purely economic project it is a community of values and principles which may act as a base for political union and for the establishment of a great area of freedom security and justice imbued with the values of solidarity 
the community framework is a special area governed by very specific political and legal rules which means that it will also be given special treatment 
we therefore want to ensure that the working of the community machine is not affected by the current situation 
madam president ladies and gentlemen the commission met yesterday morning and as an independent body and with the joint will of all the members of the college it made political decisions of the utmost importance 
it already stated yesterday that it shared the concerns expressed by member states of the union concerns that have been reiterated here by the representative of the presidency 
today on behalf of the entire commission i can repeat these concerns before you 
the commission like parliament is a supranational institution of the union and for that very reason it has no bilateral diplomatic relations with the member states 
let us not forget that the treaty of rome does not contain any clause providing for the voluntary withdrawal or the expulsion of a member state 
this is because the logic the very assumption underlying the extraordinary achievement that is the european union is that when each state becomes a member of the union it accepts its fundamental principles completely and forever 
moreover the treaties set out precise mechanisms for ensuring that these principles are respected 
from this viewpoint the commission would not be performing its role properly if it were to interrupt the working relationship it maintains with austria and with every other member state 
ladies and gentlemen when one of its members is in difficulty the whole union is in difficulty 
the duty of a strong supranational institution is not to isolate one of its members but instead to permanently bind it to its deep-seated values 
the commission will do its utmost to ensure that this is done 
on the other hand it goes without saying that the commission will continue to keep a close eye on events in austria 
indeed the european union would not survive without the principles of freedom democracy and respect for human rights 
these are the foundations of the union 
these principles are the raison d' être of the union and are the result and reflection of the formal commitment made by all the member states to respect the rights of individuals and of peoples regardless of their beliefs origin or circumstances 
these principles form an integral part of the rule of law and the commission which is the guarantor of that rule of law will be relentless in upholding them 
we will bear down heavily on even the slightest breach of the rights of individuals or of any minority 
madam president ladies and gentlemen allow me to make a few more brief remarks 
founded over years ago bologna university my alma mater is the oldest university in the world 
on the walls of one of its most beautiful halls you can still see the coats of arms of students and professors who chose that university so many centuries ago as a place of learning 
there are over coats of arms from the whole of europe ranging from transylvania to england 
europe already existed then an area whose intellectual confines were unaffected by the frontiers and limits of the politics of the day a community of shared values ideals and knowledge 
however the fabric of european history has not only been woven with cultural interchange the expansion of knowledge and the sharing of a robust core of common values 
alongside the university coats of arms there are war memorials in every small village or town in europe which bear witness to the tragedies of our continent 
european history has been punctuated over the centuries by an unremitting sequence of wars and conflicts 
europe a cradle of civilisation has given rise to the most terrible atrocities ever known in human history 
in recognition of this as the first act of my presidency i chose to visit auschwitz in order to say loud and clear in the silence that is proper and fitting for such a place of memory that europe has not forgotten and to repeat that the europe of today and tomorrow is can only be and will always be a union of freedom law security and peace 
freedom law security and peace this is what the european union was and what the european union is 
this is what the most extraordinary bold and successful political achievement of the century that just ended has been able to guarantee its citizens 
this is what the united europe wishes to offer in the century that is now beginning to those who are preparing to join it 
this afternoon at this very moment i should have been at the université catholique de louvain to receive together with the prime minister of france and the director­general of the world health organisation mrs brundtland an honorary degree 
i will be arriving a little late at that ceremony but there is no more fitting way of honouring a university which is one of the leading symbols of european learning than to come here before parliament the supreme expression of popular sovereignty in order to bear witness to my own passionate commitment and that of the entire european commission to defending those principles which form the foundations of a united europe 
i would like to thank all those who spoke with such resoluteness of purpose 
we condemn the faux pas he has made in the last few days especially those against the french president jacques chirac and the belgian government 
we categorically reject the things he has said 
we the ppe-de group champion human dignity the state under the rule of law democracy and freedom and we defend these principles and values across the political spectrum 
the christian democrats who form a key element of our group and a great many people are probably unaware of this evolved from the opposition to the totalitarianism of national socialism which was every bit as inhuman but also to the totalitarianism of those despisers of mankind the communists 
these principles are also the yardstick we use for assessing the activities dealings and words of the member states and also the governments to which we belong 
we recall how in which is not very long ago at all everyone here in parliament spoke in positive terms of the austrian presidency and the conduct of wolfgang schüssel the leader of the övp here in this chamber spoke of passion and commitment 
the people of austria have now voted and i believe we have nothing to gain from chastising the electorate 
nor should we forget that there were in fact negotiations with the spö 
i regret that they proved unsuccessful but why is this so 
because the trade union orientated part of spö was not prepared to lend its support to the promises chancellor klima made 
to wit a redevelopment programme for the economy and finances 
that is the truth and no matter how loud your protests you cannot sweep this aside 
above all they are the logical continuation of a policy of european unification which the republic of austria has been pursuing in an exemplary manner for decades 
we are right behind you when you regard yourselves as the guardian of the treaties and so let us tread this path together 
we want a europe that upholds the rule of law a europe that embraces peace and tolerance 
we do not want there to be isolation within europe rather we want to bring the peoples of europe together so as to enable the future of our continent in the twenty-first century to be one of freedom democracy and peace 
madam president president of the commission president-in-office of the council the group of the party of european socialists hopes that this debate will send three messages to the european public 
let it be noted that we are completely united on all three counts 
firstly we wish to express our total support for and our solidarity with the statement of the presidency-in-office of the council and the member states because we believe that this statement is in accordance with the common values and not just the political force which we have all built together 
in any event these common values are in complete opposition to those held by the party ironically known as the austrian freedom party 
the europe we are building is born of the bitter experiences we have all suffered and the socialist group condemns the insults which have been directed at the president of the french republic and the belgian government but also at the socialists who are european citizens as well because at the moment the austrian socialists are being described as traitors to their country 
i will say one thing 
i also believe that the commission or president prodi has acted as a guardian of the treaties 
however i would remind him that during his inaugural debate he described the commission as a european government 
a government must have more nerve and more courage 
that is what i am asking president prodi for at this moment 
with all due respect to a commissioner as effective as mr fischler and given that we have heard contradictory comments depending on the translation with regard to a possible request by president prodi for the resignation of mr fischler i would be very grateful if this point could be clarified in this house 
secondly madam president we wish to send a very clear message to the austrian people 
we should not be so politically partisan 
the accession of austria to the community was a joint venture 
we all took part in it not just one group 
therefore madam president i believe that it is our right and our obligation to ask the austrians to reconsider and reflect because this type of menace which we have suffered before in europe may not only harm austria but it may also spread and i say this bearing history in mind 
i therefore think that this is a great day for european politics to commence 
we support the council and we believe that it is our right and our obligation to appeal to the austrian people to seriously reconsider this completely crazy option 
madam president my group welcomes this debate because it is a defining moment 
this is the first time in the history of the modern european project that we stand at the threshold of seeing the mainstreaming of a party of the extreme right 
that is deeply disturbing 
the fpö contends that if one reads their literature and their programme there is much in it that one could share 
that may be but let me place on the record today a long and difficult experience which we liberal democrats had with the austrian fpö in our liberal international family 
as early as we had cause to believe that mr jörg haider was not a man whose principles or attitudes were consistent with decency and modern liberalism 
in november of after a long internal debate in liberal international and many visits to vienna to discuss issues we suspended the fpö from membership and in july we expelled them 
we expelled them then and we continue to reject what mr haider stands for now 
let me share what we learned in that long experience 
there were many in our ranks who said read the text 
there were many more in our ranks who said read the subtext look at the context 
words in politics can be incendiary can be inflammatory or can be conciliatory 
we found that mr jörg haider as a wordsmith has been a voice for racism and for xenophobia 
he is a man who plays on fear and who has exploited vulnerability 
that is why this debate is important to put down a marker that when you mainstream extremism something profound is happening in europe today 
i hasten to add that our quarrel is not with the austrian people 
we respect the rights of the austrian people to their own democratic process 
we defend the rights and constitutional prerogatives of the austrian people but we here in the european parliament have the duty to recall our fundamental values as set out in article of the treaty the values of freedom democracy and respect for human rights 
every right-thinking person in this house believes that these are universal and indivisible without regard to colour class or creed 
we must promote and defend those rights all the while saying to the people of austria our quarrel is not with you 
i wish to say with regard to the initiative of the portuguese presidency that we support the spirit and the political intention behind it 
it may not be an ideal initiative in terms of its structure but we accept mr president-in-office that it is rooted in idealism and for that reason we are inclined to support it 
i share with president prodi a preference for the community method and we must look at article and article of the treaty 
article talks about the possibility of suspension in the event of serious or persistent breaches of our fundamental values 
we must find a way as institutions to benchmark and give meaning to this so that it has a reality and a substance 
then we can work together by the community method to root out this cancer within our midst 
i want to say madame president some words to mr schüssel 
mr schüssel is a man with an honourable record in european politics 
he now intends to ride into government on the back of a political tiger 
mr schüssel you are assuming a very serious personal national and european responsibility 
that responsibility which you mr schüssel now take on is to respect the letter and the spirit of the european treaties 
finally madame president this is a debate which touches on the heart of our democratic values and institutions and calls to mind that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance 
it is a dogged insistence by the democratically elected part of the institutions of this union that we will not as europeans countenance turning the clock back 
madam president the events taking place today in austria are extremely serious 
for the first time the european union is facing the possibility of having representatives in the council of ministers and here among us of a party which obviously holds views and puts forward legislation contrary to the values of the european union 
i shall make three comments on this matter to illustrate the gravity of the problem 
i believe personally that this is the first stage if it does actually take place in the inclusion of extremists in governments becoming quite commonplace 
i also believe it gives an extremely negative political message to the vulnerable democracies which are candidates for membership of the european union and which are going to join us 
i feel finally that this is a case of political decline of the european union as such and it therefore also sends a negative message outside the union when we are speaking in the name of democracy and human rights 
some people have said that we were interfering in problems internal to austria 
some people have said that we were stigmatising the austrian people and that we were effectively putting words into the mouth of a future government 
let me thank you madam president for your contribution on behalf of parliament 
it was both pertinent and politically intelligent 
i should also like to thank the presidency of the council for the firm pertinent and moderate statement it has made 
i would like to address mr poettering and also indirectly mr martens a compatriot and former colleague 
i have heard mr poettering that you have been following events in austria 
i would rather have had you anticipate them and particularly condemn on behalf of your party the very principle of an alliance with people who practice verbal violence who stigmatise the weak who hold xenophobic views and who refuse to condemn the nazi regime 
mr poettering i do not doubt your concern for democracy but i believe that you are making a serious political mistake 
and to paraphrase one of my renowned fellow belgians one of the founders of europe paul-henri spaak i shall say that it is not yet too late for you but now is the time to change your mind 
the european union has certainly previously known situations where there were people in a member state government whose ideas and actions were in contradiction to the guiding values of the union 
however with haider and his men we would see the extreme right openly racist anti-semitic and xenophobic promoted to the rank of co-ruler of our community 
going along with such a prospect would be tantamount to testifying albeit unwillingly to the respectability of a political force which is not respectable 
it would mean making the unacceptable commonplace on the scale of europe as a whole it would mean making nonsense of the european institutions' solemn proclamations on the fundamental values which unite us and which we demand rightly so of applicants for membership 
this is why we support the spirit of the statement made by the presidency and the member states as well as that of the president of the european parliament insofar as unlike the lacklustre and ambiguous statement made by the commission it aims to make people get the measure of the danger and to provoke a response 
of course there can be no question of casting opprobrium upon the people of austria 
any action which can be taken must in our opinion serve the twofold function of proscribing haider without however isolating austrian society 
democrats in this country now need our support more than ever 
the great joining of forces in protest in vienna on november last year must now undergo developments suited to the new situation 
we must have dialogue with them and join forces with them stand at their side in order to offer the people of austria some alternative prospects 
finally we must ask ourselves how did we come to be in this position 
certainly in the first instance as far as austrian political leaders are concerned it is a matter of answering this existential question for the future of democracy starting with those who have just taken the inordinate risk of giving the extreme right a boost 
but beyond that no one including the european union can in our opinion be exempted from asking themselves what grounds there are for permitting an unscrupulous demagogue to exploit the frustrations and fears generated by policies in which too many sectors of the population are disregarded 
this debate is now before us but each and every one of us male and female is going to assume their responsibilities without delay 
madam president we could have been debating the need to reinforce the founding principles of the union so that we can uphold them together 
instead we have been forced to debate the formal substantial errors that have been made in the last few days 
we have never before seen such serious clumsy interference in the internal affairs of a member state 
of course we cannot violate the founding values of europe and in this regard the italian prime minister stated that these principles are included in a treaty he mentioned the treaty of copenhagen which i like you have never heard of because it does not exist 
maybe he was referring to the treaty of amsterdam article of which lists certain principles and article certain procedures in order to establish that a member state is seriously and continuously violating the principles referred to in article 
however up till now austria has committed no serious or persistent violation 
apart from amounting to interference the statement by the presidency is discriminatory because it authorises the penalisation of a population and denies these people their right to choose who to vote for 
sanctions can be imposed after the treaties have been violated but cannot be applied if a democratically elected party enters government 
bilateral relations involve the states so the do not come into this 
this is riding roughshod over the european institutions in order to defend political ways of thinking with an incompetence worthy of parties which have just emerged from totalitarian regimes 
it is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions 
so many things set us apart from mr haider as we have often written including his claim to the completely italian alto adige region 
however we already knew this 
we support legality and democracy as expressed by the peoples and favour upholding national sovereignty as long as this does not violate the principles of the treaty or human rights 
we believe in europe while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the union 
this is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks 
we have built a europe with an unstable market not a europe with principles rights and politics 
and these are the consequences 
therefore we can but call on the commission to continue to show restraint and praise those who are working to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the austrian people thereby ensuring that this people retains its freedoms and maintains good relations with other peoples 
madam president today we have an appointment with hypocrisy 
here we have a council which has managed to flout the treaty and employ a method completely unrelated to articles and which make it possible to condemn a state in the event of a serious and persistent breach 
in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in austria 
there are risks as we are all aware but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach 
if we were to apply the criteria of articles and or the copenhagen criteria to the european union then most certainly this european union could not become a member although the countries of eastern europe are required to meet them 
and if we were to speak of serious and persistent breaches then perhaps we could mention some member states such as italy and france first and third respectively in the list of countries condemned by the council of europe and the strasbourg court 
we could mention my belgian friends belgium and the dutroux case the dozens upon dozens of children kidnapped tortured raped and murdered by leading personalities in this country where inquiries are bogged down making no headway 
we could if one third of the members of parliament so requested require that the council and the commission look into the matter 
we could ask ourselves why the austrians are rejecting years years of party politics which has made one country austria corrupt and rotten just as it is now corrupting countries such as italy belgium and other european union member states 
madame president my group the edd and especially my party are very concerned by this debate 
we cannot and we do not support in any way the sentiments and politics of herr haider and we deplore his references to the third reich 
we also however deplore the fact that your parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country especially one which is part of the european union 
my party at home are certainly not racists but we do not accept the rule or interference of the european union very well 
madame president the people of austria have spoken by electing herr haider to their parliament 
i believe they gave him % of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government 
your parliament may i suggest madame president should wait to see if the party of haider has an effect on the policies of that country 
then and only then might you consider if human rights are affected 
your parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then madame president and only then may your parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the european union 
madam president as a representative of the freedom party i respect the concerns some of my fellow meps have with regard to the democratic developments in austria 
austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it rightly or wrongly 
the refusal of our government down through the years to acknowledge our complicity in the horrors of the second world war together with their refusal to properly compensate the jewish victims and those forced into hard labour have done a great deal to bolster this negative image 
this fpö has now entered into a coalition with the övp due to the outcome of elections held on october when the previous government was voted out of office 
when the talks between the spö and övp broke down the socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the fpö for their support 
we were offered three ministerial posts you can read it for yourself in the newspapers the very party that is being denounced as fascistic here 
when we suddenly refused this offer an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day 
the head of the government of one of the nine provinces belongs to this party and it is involved in all the other provincial governments 
what many austrians are wondering today is why their democratic decision has suddenly been interpreted as an expression of a fascistic cast of mind and why the campaign did not begin until the freedom party rejected the support of a minority government comprising the spö 
there is prejudice at work here which without going into our programme is reducing the darkest hour of european history to a political spectacle 
i am filled with disgust when certain of our opponents get mileage out of the millions of deaths that took place in the gas chambers of the concentration camps as cheap propaganda as for example the italian mep bertinotti did yesterday on italian tv when he accused mr haider of denying the holocaust 
shame on you mr bertinotti 
you might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda 
denouncing a democratically elected politician as a nazi does not make you an anti-fascist 
on the contrary you are deriding the true victims of national socialism and playing down what the fascist dictators did 
your behaviour stems from your own prejudices you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose 
that is why we are indebted to the commission for taking a stance that separates it from the rest 
the new coalition agreement is about reforming a democracy the rights of the opposition commitment to compensating those forced into hard labour 
madam president to begin with i would like to make one thing abundantly clear austria is not in danger of experiencing a resurgence of a one-party system or of a totalitarian system of right-wing persuasion 
austria is a stable democracy one in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed under the constitution and are afforded the protection of an independent judiciary 
austria is a cosmopolitan country and xenophobia and discrimination have no place there 
there is nothing unusual about what is happening in austria there has been a changeover of power following democratic elections in consequence of which an old system was voted out and a stable parliamentary majority prepared to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms was sought and found 
there will be a functioning majority and likewise a functioning opposition 
we respect and accept the discussion that is taking place and also appreciate the concerns that are being voiced in many of our member states as to the way ahead for austria 
our understanding springs from the knowledge that our history of the recent past has bequeathed to us a political responsibility of special importance in the present 
our country was not just the first victim of the hitler dictatorship many people were perpetrators too although i refute any suggestion of collective guilt 
the övp played no small part in helping austria find its way into the european union 
with all the rights and commitments that this entails 
any future government must therefore be judged according to the values and principles it professes to in its manifesto and not according to the prejudgements put about both by political adversaries and the international media 
my party can be relied upon to see to it that my country holds firm to the course of european politics and continues to be rooted in the european community of values 
madam president mr president-in-office of the council representatives of the commission it is a black day for austria and for europe 
they are just as prepared to take on board the fact that austria will go from being a revered country to a reviled one as they are its threatened isolation and thus to some extent that of its citizens 
i believe as do many who for years have campaigned against haider and his brand of politics and especially my colleagues in the social democratic delegation in this chamber that the various measures announced by the international community insofar as they do not have any bearing on the government and its representatives are grave and also inappropriate 
however my criticism and i freely admit this my rage is directed exclusively against those who have provoked these reactions and continue to do so messrs schüssel and haider and their parties 
and that includes their representatives in this parliament 
mr poettering it is interesting to note that you are in almost as difficult a position as i am albeit for different reasons for you are having to defend something that goes against your convictions 
the argument that mr poettering himself used has come into play i.e that it would only be possible to deprive haider of his mystique if he were to be integrated into the political system 
however in my view he will be no more able or willing to be integrated into this into our political system and into the europe of today than any other extreme right-wing movement 
anyone who feeds on prejudice towards foreigners and ethnic minorities and gives succour to these prejudices whose programme features parochialism and anti-liberalism who displays loutish behaviour and arrogance in their international relations and who has never yet distanced themselves clearly and unequivocally from national socialism has neither the intention nor inclination to integrate 
this historic weight of guilt falls on the shoulders of the conservatives for having consorted with the wolf of their own free will and waiting to be devoured 
that is how the wolf albeit on account of the self-sacrifice of the övp is sustained rather than kept in check 
i understand that europe and the civilised world wants to have as little as possible to do with such a government 
however by the same token there is another austria the one where umpteen thousand people demonstrated against the fpö having any involvement in government and who will continue to demonstrate against this government 
i urge you to support this europe and to support and help this austria 
the more powerful this europe becomes and the more vigilant it is towards authoritarian tendencies in the europe of today the more successful we will be in striking at the roots of right-wing extremism 
for europe is and will remain the most potent guarantee we have against xenophobia and demagogy or even against a relapse into barbarism 
please support the austrian people against this government 
madam president this is an historic moment as it is now at last quite clear to us all that the european union has gradually developed into a community of values 
we see this now that the government of one member state is being joined by a party which as is known does not respect all these values 
i would also like to say that the position of the fourteen states emanating from the council was justified as in a way this is also a matter of the composition of the government of the european union meaning this is also a matter for the council and not merely an internal affair of austria' s 
as members of parliament we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begun to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever 
it is more important than ever that respect for and non-violation of human values and the rights of minorities including the rights of all those who live within the territory of the european union form an essential component in the rule of law principle of the eu and for this reason the charter of fundamental rights must be made legally binding 
it must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration 
we know that most austrians respect these values 
they have also shown how they feel not all the demonstrations have taken place outside austria 
doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in austrian policy for a long time 
i believe parliament should support these forces of democracy 
i also appeal to the austrian president that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces 
madam president i would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group francis wurtz reminded us of just now 
the fact that we are stressing this is all the more important because as you know we essentially disagree with the policies made by europe with its economic and social policies its democratic deficit and the member states' involvement in the terrible war in the balkans 
our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational neo-nazi element in europe is extraordinary 
this danger does not concern austria it concerns europe 
we are talking about us not austria 
we know the social causes which contribute along with unemployment and instability to fuelling tendencies towards this we know the accompanying cultural causes xenophobia racism but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right-wing groups to settle accounts with nazism we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an explosive mixture being created in europe 
not only the alpine region but all our countries are involved the conditions are being created whereby democracy and european civilisation may once again come under threat 
the position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation 
europe is showing that it has not forgotten auschwitz europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past 
madam president despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples which opposes fascism nazism or communism both new and old and despite all the previous speakers talking about the sovereignty of the austrian people we are today witnessing this sovereignty being denied by parliament 
in the manifesto of the austrian democratic freedom party there is nothing to justify the accusations that it is attacking the principles of freedom democracy and respect for human rights fundamental freedoms or the rule of law enshrined in article of the treaties 
madam president we are debating an extremely serious issue 
of course austria is a sovereign nation and of course we must respect the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of a member state 
however that is not the problem 
the question is whether the union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a member state which includes such a party 
our answer to this crucial question is no 
we agree with its substance its tone and its scope 
konrad adenauer once said and he knew what he was saying that the surest way to pacify a tiger was to allow it to devour you 
history is a compendium of events which could have been avoided 
the one and only significance of the european union is the will to transcend the atrocious history of the twentieth century which gave the coup de grâce to any ideal of humanism within the heart of europe and which is still highly topical today 
it is not true to say that when a government forms an alliance with neo-fascists somewhere in europe this is merely a question of national sovereignty 
for this union of ours is not a grouping of neighbouring nation states who are simply coming to mutual arrangements to improve their collective circumstances 
it is a community that is destined to exist in which when the main thing is under threat when values are under threat all democrats must bend over backwards to find solutions to ensure that the mistakes of the past are never made again 
let us learn the lessons of the past 
they put their own petty squabbles first and the rest is history 
we must make a rapid strong and united response 
i would have liked to hear your discussion with the austrian president mr poettering 
we are well aware that he is very embarrassed today at the dirty deal that government has done in forming such an alliance 
so our response must be rapid and strong 
history has taught us that fascists start to blow hot and cold using heated words first in populist xenophobic speeches and then cool words in order to make themselves acceptable to institutions and to infiltrate them gradually poisoning them until the day they start to take action 
and when that day comes it is too late 
so our treaty has made provision for barriers for the time when it is too late but we are not at that point today we have to take steps to ensure that we do not get to that point 
we must therefore find a political solution 
i support the council proposals in this while deploring a certain lack of strength a certain spinelessness on the part of the commission which will however have to be vigilant on a day-by-day basis with determination over time since fascists count on the spinelessness of democracy they count on time to wear us down and they hope to impose their views in the end 
our response must be rapid 
if today we do not staunchly support the council then history will judge us saying that we achieved the political equivalent of the munich agreement 
madam president i am pleased about the fact that in austria the will of the large majority of the people is being respected and that this formation of government constitutes in my eyes a huge victory for democracy 
let there be no doubt about it we decline with thanks a europe which develops into a kind of big brother and which keeps watch over left-wing political correctness in one member state or another in a stalinist way and using stalinist methods 
european democracy and austrian democracy should not receive any lessons from anybody and certainly not from a belgian government that embraces corrupt parties financed by arms dealers and that appointed the leader of such a corrupt party which was condemned by the court to the post of european commissioner 
today we thank the austrian people for this democratic triumph which is important to all nations within europe and to anyone who feels particularly strongly about freedom and freedom of speech 
madam president this debate was opened by mr da costa who merely confirms that the eu presidency is trying to influence the composition of a government of one of the member states 
this debate and the background to it reinforced the point that the council the commission and this parliament itself are dominated by socialists 
we share the widespread outrage at its attitude to history in particular world war ii but also its policies on enlargement on immigration on race and its attitude to the european union itself 
we were also outraged however at the tolerance of the left for the tyranny the terror and the excesses of the former ussr 
this madam president is the hypocrisy of the left 
so we condemn that hypocrisy and the double standards especially of the british government and the other largely socialist heads of eu governments and include that of the united states 
we should recognise however that the democratic process sometimes produces uncomfortable results 
this requires action to address the underlying causes including an examination of the electoral process itself 
that should be our task not political posturing 
madam president representative of the council commissioner a week ago the big international holocaust conference ended in stockholm 
it would be an insult to the idea behind this conference and to the whole of the international community to invite at this time into the institutions of the eu a xenophobic party which flirts with nazi ideas 
secondly i want to say that we must be consistent in our own behaviour and in our evaluations 
we demand of the candidate states and of the countries with which the eu cooperates under the lomé agreement that they should respect human rights and show tolerance towards their neighbours 
we must do the same as far as we ourselves are concerned 
that is why we are reacting against this carry-on in austria 
it is not acceptable to continue as if nothing had happened 
we are at a watershed in the history of the european union 
the union is not only an economic community but also a community of values something which we take seriously 
something has happened 
the european union is in the process of finding its soul and getting some steel in its spine 
madam president as everyone has said this is a very important day 
it is the day of the first debate of european political life 
and this is not pure chance 
it is the meeting of europe with itself with its raison d' être with the reasons why we are here in this chamber 
this chamber was not made for goods it was not made for money 
this chamber and the european institutions were build to uphold values morality and a certain spirit 
in the twentieth century we have had experience of the fact that democracies can find themselves at risk and morality values and the spirit which i mentioned can be mortally affected by viruses which have just one name nationalist glorification populism and the concept of racial superiority 
reading only one sentence which my friend mr vidal-quadras has previously mentioned the nation is defined by its location culture and race locally ethnically and culturally 
well we cannot accept such statements 
if europe has any meaning and my friends will pardon me telling them if christian democracy has any meaning if the history of christian democracy has any meaning then it must declare itself radically opposed to the statements made in this manifesto and whatever excellent reasons are given whenever history serves the same dish up again must reject any agreement with this type of ideology and this type of organisation 
this is the reason why i feel that the european parliament which has more freedom of action and more freedom to speak than the council or the commission must pay tribute to those people in the various states and european institutions who had the courage to say no and it must say madam president that you made a statement on our behalf which does us credit and in clear terms declare without prevarication its opposition to and condemnation of imminent events in austria recalling the statement made on the day of the munich agreement by a great french christian democrat who said that if you are going to have to say no then the best time to do so is right at the beginning 
madam president we the belgian christian democrats are concerned as fortunately are a great many other members too 
the coalition which is being created in one of the member states is clearly an austrian affair but undoubtedly has a european dimension too 
because what is it that unites us in europe 
surely it is the values and principles of freedom democracy and respect for human rights more than anything 
the austrian freedom party leader mr haider has repeatedly repudiated these values 
he also repudiates the basic forms of diplomatic politeness 
he is a dangerous man 
the christian democratic parties in my country have made up their minds a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protests of extreme-right voters but never to negotiate with extreme-right leaders 
values should take precedence over power 
we deplore therefore what is happening in austria 
in fact we were shaken by it 
we are extremely disappointed 
as a last resort we would ask the övp to look into alternatives 
we keep reminding them about article of the treaty 
we continue to fight against the trivialisation of the extreme right 
if despite this the coalition goes ahead we would urge the övp party members to ensure that the principles and values which underlie european integration are observed in political programmes both in word and deed 
madam president austria awaits a heavy responsibility 
madam president it is clear that we in this parliament are very largely agreed on rejecting mr haider and his politics but it is equally clear that opinion differs as to the most effective way of opposing this brand of politics 
have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the council presidency last weekend are having in austria itself 
have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here 
have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow mep was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in austria in the course of the next few days 
from all accounts this would only serve to strengthen haider 
who would want this to happen 
is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics 
europe is a community of law 
democracy respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold 
one of the precepts of democracy is that we should not disapprove of electoral outcomes but respect them and that is why we must respect the fact that the austrians by virtue of their political culture voted as they did 
it is for reasons of constitutionality that the president-in-office of the council ought not to have made the statement he did and in a manner that goes against the treaty 
it would be politically astute not to isolate the övp but to support it as an undeniably democratic constitutional and well-known european party so as to be equally certain that austria will continue to be a member of this european community and that is why we must give the övp our support in this difficult situation and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take 
first of all could i express my thanks on behalf of president prodi and my colleagues in the commission for the support and understanding offered by several members of the house to the position taken by the commission in the statement that we made yesterday 
i am duty- bound to say to this house there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered or indeed the action taken by the commission on this issue 
we made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement as did the president this afternoon to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen member states in their statement on monday 
secondly we said in very specific terms that we will work closely with all member states in examining the situation as it develops in austria 
thirdly we expressed in very explicit terms that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of article of the treaty and that we will take our part under article of the treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are upheld 
there is no complacency no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all 
and when i say that the commission took that view i include my dear colleague franz fischler who is from austria and who once again demonstrated his integrity and his independence as a member of the european commission under oath in being part of that statement that we made yesterday morning 
anyone therefore who invites franz fischler to his house to somehow account for the fact that his nationality is austrian should examine their own motives in the context of a debate which has been necessarily shadowed by references to xenophobia and even more lethal evils in this world 
i say that in friendship and honour to my friend and colleague franz fischler 
in order to ensure that the treaty is upheld and that we sustain what was described as the community machine we are following the course of action which was set down in our statement yesterday 
we will continue to do that madam president without fear or favour 
that is our duty 
it is also a matter of conviction 
my final point is this 
we understand the context of this essential debate 
we understand that and we recall too the sometimes short and selective memory that he has of nazism 
and when we recall that like many others on all sides of this house my and my colleagues' instincts are naturally aroused 
however the commission has to act on the basis of values and law and not only on the basis of instinct 
and that is why we came to the conclusion we reached yesterday morning 
that is why we sustain that conclusion as we continue to uphold the values and the law 
without fragility without complacency without ambiguity but in the service of the whole union and every member state of the union and its people 
i wonder since mr da costa has been listening to these remarks from the back of the chamber whether mr kinnock could confirm that the commission supports the view explicitly stated by mr da costa today and in the recent statement by the presidency on behalf of the heads of government 
does the commission support the council 
madam president when the commission said yesterday morning that it notes the views expressed as a joint statement by fourteen member states and shares the concern that gave rise to that view i think it can be taken for granted that since yesterday morning as soon as the commission could discuss the issue it has had a view consistent with that of fourteen of the member states 
thank you commissioner kinnock 
i think that we have just had a great political debate equal to the situation and to what could be expected of it 
thank you ladies and gentlemen 
the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance is closed 
the vote will take place at a.m. tomorrow 
the next item is the commission statement on recourse to the precautionary principle 
i want to start by saying that i am pleased to be presenting this communication on the use of the precautionary principle and it has been written together with david byrne and erkki liikanen 
the precautionary principle is not a new concept 
it has been used by the community for some time now in a range of policy areas environmental human animal and plant health and it is explicitly mentioned in the environmental provisions of the ec treaty since maastricht 
it also appears in a range of international texts for example the rio declaration and most recently the bio-safety protocol 
the essence of the precautionary principle is clear 
it involves taking action in a given policy area when the science is not clear but where there are reasonable grounds for concern that the potential risks are big enough to require action 
however the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the spotlight in recent years 
events such as the bse and dioxin crisis have stimulated a growing public debate about the circumstances in which precautionary action is justified and necessary 
in view of this growing interest the commission therefore considered that it would be useful to present a communication to set out its position on the use of the precautionary principle 
the basic aim of the communication is twofold 
to explain in a clear and coherent way how the commission applies and intends to apply the precautionary principle in its management of risk and to set out guidelines for its application based on reasoned and coherent principles 
we also hope that the communication will help to build a better common understanding of how to manage risks and to dispel fears that the precautionary principle might be used in an arbitrary way or as a disguised form of trade protectionism 
of course this objective cannot be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures but it does mean that action can still be taken even in situations where the science is unclear 
as such while the precautionary principle does not involve the politicisation of science as some have alleged it does take us to the crossroads between science and politics 
the initial decision to apply the precautionary principle depends largely on the level of protection sought and the level of risk that decision-makers are prepared to accept for society 
it is therefore political by nature 
however the measures that may subsequently be taken must obviously comply with the general principles applicable to risk management and the guidelines for applying the precautionary principle are therefore the key element of the paper 
measures taken must be proportional to the chosen level of protection that is we do not use the sledgehammer to crack a nut 
they must be non-discriminatory in their application that is measures should not differentiate on the basis of geographical origin 
and they must be consistent with similar measures already taken 
for example if one product has been approved similar products should also be approved 
measures are based on an examination of the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action that is the measures should be cost-effective and subject to review in the light of new scientific data and be clear about who is responsible for producing the scientific evidence necessary for a more comprehensive risk assessment that is the burden of proof 
all these elements have to apply cumulatively 
it is also important to bear in mind that there are a wide range of measures which can be taken in applying the precautionary principle 
for example a research programme public information campaigns recommendations and so on 
applying the precautionary principle does not therefore automatically imply a ban 
this communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue however it is the first time that the commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use 
by setting out in some detail how the commission applies and intends to apply the precautionary principle we hope to be able to clarify the situation at community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at european and international level 
mr president commissioner thank you very much for your statement 
i have three short questions the first being as follows 
we have been awaiting a common communication from the commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the commission speaks with one voice 
does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the commissioners for industry foreign trade competition and the internal market 
i am sure that your answer to this will be yes but i would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be 
my next question mrs wallström is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors for example 
lastly will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation 
in other words will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached 
 
thank you very much dagmar roth-behrendt for these questions 
of course this is shared by the whole commission 
this is a common communication which was written by the three of us david byrne erkki liikanen and myself but it has been passed unanimously in the commission today 
it received strong support from the rest of the commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the commission 
so we have really worked through this document and i am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document 
yes i would say we already use this way of working with different difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example 
and i am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle 
we have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft pvc toys and of course we apply it in several different environmental areas 
it has been mainly used in the environmental field but of course also when it comes to human health 
so we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it 
mr president commissioner regarding the relationship between science on the one hand and applying the precautionary principle on the other the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence 
needless to say this accords science a great deal of power 
we might ask ourselves what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for 
the communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists 
i would like to ask what is then the definition of a recognised minority 
how would you describe this 
what establishes a recognised minority 
if a political decision is involved i would also like to ask who takes this political decision 
the commission 
the council 
and to what extent will the european parliament be able to play a role in this 
what is the role of the scientific committees 
what also will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up 
finally will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent public way 
these are my three questions 
 
yes mr president that is true 
there were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear but i will try to answer some questions 
who will take the decision who are the decision-makers 
well that depends on who the legislators are 
this is part of risk management 
they have to look at for example the concerns of people in relation to a special issue and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case 
however it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle 
it can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete 
that is of course where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science 
it is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done but there is no question of changing the scientific base 
we use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision and that should also be done in the future 
you have to see this as a tool for risk management 
you have to decide whether you want to put people in danger for example or if you want to protect the environment and you have to look at the science that is available 
you have to assess all that and evaluate the science 
then you decide to take a measure or not to take action or not 
so there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today 
mr president i have a question concerning an actual concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle 
it is about brominated flame retardants 
it is a fact that these substances are now being discovered 
there are increased concentrations of them in both people and the environment 
there are many people who maintain that they entail major risks while others question how large the risks involved in these substances really are 
recently both sweden and denmark urged the commission in the council of ministers to take the initiative and ban brominated flame retardants 
i am wondering therefore if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative 
 
the issue of brominated flame retardants is an important one 
it was raised quite recently in the environment council by a number of ministers who want the commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done 
we are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do 
allow me to remind you however that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban 
there may be a series of different measures which can be taken 
it ought not therefore to be immediately interpreted as a ban 
where brominated flame retardants are concerned there may eventually be a ban but it is important to say that the precautionary principle permits the whole spectrum of political measures and initiatives to be taken 
this issue is extremely topical 
the commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done 
you said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier 
is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the atlantic ocean 
i think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone-treated beef and genetically modified crops 
will the americans take the same view of this point as we do 
 
we succeeded there in agreeing at an international forum as to the definition of the precautionary principle 
i consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeeded in concluding this protocol 
i believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle 
we are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be interpreted 
it is moreover also accepted as an important and effective tool 
mr president i have two questions 
i shall try to be very brief indeed 
the first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle 
as i have understood it there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood 
is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out including a cost-benefit analysis 
in that case i am rather concerned because the idea was really that a cost-benefit analysis should not be used as a tool for deciding whether the precautionary principle should be introduced 
instead the precautionary principle should come first 
my second question concerns the burden of proof 
i remember margot wallström being introduced as commissioner in the committee 
at that time she was talking about the desire for a reversed burden of proof 
i want to know whether this also applies in the document which the commission has presented now 
 
these are two important questions and it is good that i should be given the opportunity to clarify them 
no one must not begin by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis 
instead the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals 
when on the other hand the decision has been made to take a certain measure the one chosen ought to be cost-effective so that there is in fact no resort to measures which are wholly unreasonable given their degree of effectiveness 
it is not therefore the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis 
the second question concerns the reversed burden of proof 
it is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases 
i have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this 
there however we are concerned with that particular area whereas it may be said that the present communication concerning the precautionary principle is horizontal in the sense that it concerns the full range of specific technical areas that are of political concern 
therefore the issues of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context 
instead it is a question of political decision-making and of the bases for this 
it is however perfectly correct that when it comes for example to chemicals we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof 
mr president i believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible 
i will give an example a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind 
it is therefore a teratogenic substance 
very well it is a fungicide it kills off mould 
this teratogenicity has been demonstrated by just one english laboratory perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests 
now in my opinion given that this is such a serious risk to health the precautionary principle lays down that this product should immediately be taken off the market which new zealand has done for example 
so i want to put this question to you 
when human health is at stake or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected should we not perhaps carry out a cost-benefit analysis 
the cost of a baby being born blind is too high there are no benefits that can compensate for this 
in short commissioner i would therefore like to know whether in this case the precautionary principle as you understand it would in any case require the product to be taken off the market until such time as another laboratory provides evidence to the contrary 
 
obviously i cannot adopt a stance on this special case and on the particular product which has been mentioned here but i shall go directly back and see what i can obtain in the way of information about this particular case 
the truth of course is that a great many member states and no doubt other nations too have taken measures to protect their populations' health which amount to using the precautionary principle even if it has not always been called that 
naturally it is not in the first place a question of cost there can in fact be an enormous cost to society if the decision to take a particular measure is avoided 
nor must it be a case of sitting and calculating the value of a human life over and against the cost of taking a particular measure 
i think however it is quite obvious that when it is eventually time to decide upon a particular step to be taken it is often the case that there are many different courses of action to choose between 
in those circumstances consideration should be given to what is likely to produce the best result 
i cannot forbear telling you about an occasion when the expression cost-effective was used by people whom one cannot perhaps imagine using it namely when i was on a visit to africa 
at a hospice for aids patients i met two irish catholic nuns who were caring for dying aids patients 
they were the first to say that each day they must think about doing what is most cost-effective because resources had to suffice for their poor patients there 
we must be very careful about how we use resources 
i believe we can learn something from this 
we must of course always ensure that we use our resources in the most effective manner and in such a way that they provide the broadest possible help 
as is also explained in the present communication it is not therefore correct that one must first begin with some sort of cost-benefit analysis 
mr president it is a rare honour to be given a second opportunity to ask questions 
commissioner i would like to come back again to my first question when i asked about the other commissioners for it may have sounded as though i was in jest 
indeed you responded in kind as i knew you would do 
i would like to draw your attention to something mr goodwill asked that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the european union 
i have good reason for asking this 
as you rightly said the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where as yet there is no scientific evidence 
how can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time for example by our partners in the usa on account of the bio safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes 
how can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy will not as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors keep pulling the carpet from underneath you 
that is exactly what it is all about otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here commissioner 
i am certain that we are going to have more conflicts for example with the united states 
we should not be so naïve as to think otherwise 
ever since we signed this protocol in montreal we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition written into a protocol dealing with the environment health and trade 
this constitutes a good example therefore 
we should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily 
we now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it something which is clearly established in the present communication 
thank you commissioner 
the focus on the political precautionary principle means that we have being discussing it for almost two hours and this topic is now being viewed so to speak as more than an ordinary aspect of administration even though as we have been able to establish from the interventions questions and replies it is a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance 
the debate is closed 
mr president i will begin by thanking the portuguese presidency and the commission for all our recent very useful contacts 
let me also once more thank my co-rapporteur mr leinen for our excellent collaboration 
the intergovernmental conference that is about to begin is important both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement 
the work of the conference will determine the structure and method based on which europe will be functioning in the twentieth century 
for the european union of the future to be able to function more effectively more democratically and with complete transparency clearly what we need is an extensive and in-depth reform of the institutions and the way they work 
the first and substantive prerequisite for achieving that reform is the agenda based on which the intergovernmental conference is to begin its work 
from the decisions made at the helsinki summit it emerges that the agenda agreed there is unsatisfactory and does not guarantee the essential and substantive changes required for creating a more functional europe one that is more effective more democratic and more transparent 
i will not repeat which ones because everyone knows 
my conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insistent demands of the peoples of europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the european union is already involved namely enlargement 
just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which for that very reason are highly visible to the european public 
in its numerous debates and its reports so far the european parliament has openly supported the convening of the intergovernmental conference 
at the same time however i am asking for it to include issues that improve and complement the reform i repeat of all the institutional bodies as well as issues that are of direct concern and interest to the european public such as health energy culture transport and even tourism 
whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point i would like to extol the political conduct of the portuguese presidency which has repeatedly made a commitment to the european parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end 
all the same whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every member state to the intergovernmental conference 
the same applies to the commission and i would again like to thank commissioner barnier for his collaboration with the european parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us 
mr president mr president-in-office of the council commissioner in common with my co-rapporteur mr dimitrakopoulos i take the view that the agenda agreed on in helsinki is not up to meeting the challenges that enlargement of the eu by new states will bring 
as far as we are concerned mini reform would represent a lost opportunity 
mini reform would also jeopardise the stability of the european union 
the european parliament could not indeed must not allow the european union to be jeopardised in this way that is by overstretching it and falling short when it comes to deepening 
we would like to take this opportunity to remind the governments once again that parliament must give its consent before a new member can accede to the union 
parliament is also sure to form the decision it has to make on enlargement in the light of the outcome of this intergovernmental conference 
on november we named the key points on our agenda for the intergovernmental conference 
i would just like to reiterate a few points provisions for reinforced cooperation with these and member states integrating security and defence policy into the community framework incorporating the charter of citizens' rights into the new treaty constitutionalising the union by dividing it into a main part and a subsidiary part reforming article so that when it comes to future treaty amendments parliament will play a real part in the negotiations on an equal footing and another thing worthy of mention a statute for european parties so that the next european elections are actually fought on the basis of european issues rather than taking the form of national debates on domestic policy 
last but not least there is the strengthening of institutions and instruments for the common economic social and employment policy as a counterbalance to european monetary union and the single currency which we have of course already adopted 
in addition to a wider agenda we also want an improved method for the elaboration of this new european treaty 
in the interests of the citizens we must provide for greater transparency in the political process during the intergovernmental conference 
the union has a two-fold basis of legitimacy it is a union of states but it is also a union of peoples 
it is high time that this found expression in the method for elaborating a new treaty 
all the more reason for the representatives of the european parliament to participate fully in the preparation group at ministerial level as well as at the meetings of the european council insofar as this council concerns itself with matters pertaining to the intergovernmental conference 
the national governments decided to open this intergovernmental conference on february 
i cannot deny that many of my fellow meps would have preferred to have waited until we had a report from the portuguese presidency to hand following its tour of the capital cities so as to be able to discover if there is any progress towards or impetus for a wider agenda 
however we have faith in the portuguese presidency and we have faith in the commitment it has testified to here to proposing additional points for the agenda at the lisbon summit in march 
we urge the governments to support the portuguese presidency in its proposal 
as such this represents a vote of confidence and we very much hope that we will not be disappointed if we deliver our opinion at this early stage without knowing exactly what there is in the way of fresh impetus and what the additional points on the agenda will be 
the opinion we are placing before you is a clear signal to the governments not to miss the last opportunity we will have before enlargement to implement ambitious reforms within the eu and to raise the level of acceptance of this next european treaty which is more transparent and provides for the full participation of parliament 
i too would like to thank the portuguese presidency and commissioner barnier for their cooperation 
i would urge this parliament to produce a consensus of opinion in favour of adopting our opinion 
mr president ladies and gentlemen first of all i would like to express my gratitude for the confidence the previous two speakers have expressed in the work the portuguese presidency has done on this subject 
in fact we regard this as a unique opportunity to adapt the union to enlargement and we must do so in a way that combines a certain degree of ambition with the need to achieve results by the end of this year 
this is the obstacle we all face which will certainly be heightened by the difficulties certain governments will have in getting measures through their parliaments or in some cases approved in national referendums 
we must be aware that we face a ratification process which will take around two years and that it is crucial that we guarantee its success 
any failure would be a failure for the whole union 
i believe that the mechanism we have proposed for this conference has been very well received by the various governments 
the establishment of a preparatory group which i chair was also a response to the concerns expressed by the european parliament about the scope for its representatives to intervene at this stage in the negotiations 
i am therefore counting on the work of our friends mr broke and mr tsatsos who will doubtless prove extremely valuable participants in the discussions within that group 
i would like to add that our understanding is that they will be able to participate fully just like any other group member appointed by a member state or representing the commission 
i also consider that in choosing its foreign minister to chair the ministerial group the portuguese presidency is also trying to give a signal that it wishes to ensure that the president of the european parliament has a sufficiently high-level representative and not one at a level which could conceivably be interpreted as being less worthy of the role of the president of an institution such as this parliament 
madam president ladies and gentlemen it is difficult to summarise the contacts and the significance of the contacts that i have had with the various member states particularly because i have not yet finished this tour of the capitals in the course of which i have tried to find out how the different countries see the conference and what their expectations for it are 
in any event many governments feel that they will be able to accept various topics that i have suggested 
these topics are obviously related to those institutional issues that the portuguese presidency regards as coming within its mandate 
i would like to make this quite clear our mandate which was given to us in helsinki does not as portugal sees it cover just the three amsterdam leftovers 
the mandate that we brought back from helsinki does indeed the three amsterdam leftovers but it also covers associated institutional issues 
these strike us as being very important particularly those dealing with the structure of this parliament itself in a post-enlargement context 
there are also issues such as the provisional measures that will have to be implemented if enlargement takes place before the end of this parliamentary term as well as the individual responsibility of the commissioners 
finally there is a whole raft of issues that we feel can and must be included in the agenda of this conference 
the member states are apparently open to this possibility 
i would like to say that it is my intention that initiatives taken during the portuguese presidency should start and move ahead quickly and with a substantial input of work 
i do not intend to start the work of the preparatory group merely as a kind of superficial revision of certain issues acting as mr napolitano claimed as a kind of scribe for the positions adopted by the various member states 
i am not seeking to be a scribe 
what i am trying to do is to put forward concrete proposals for specific issues with the obvious risk that these proposals may not be accepted 
we intend to divide the work of the preparatory group into two stages in the course of which all of the issues will be studied 
the first stage would begin with qualified majority voting and the members would then try to identify institutional issues relating to the leftovers and only at that point would we address the issue of the commission and the weighting of votes 
the issue of closer cooperation would be included with institutional issues 
in the final part that is the second stage we would revisit the set of issues that had already been addressed which had been discussed at ministerial meetings and we would also try to identify the range of new issues that might be added to the agenda 
knowing whether security and defence issues had already had been fully discussed in the meetings reserved for them would play a crucial role in deciding whether we could integrate them into the final stage of the conference 
the same thing could be said about the charter of fundamental rights 
we will see when the time comes whether the discussions being held specifically on this issue will lead to conclusions enabling us to include this issue in the intergovernmental conference particularly in the second half of this year 
we will be presenting a report to the lisbon european council which will of course have to be of a factual nature given that we will be making the report in march only having convened the conference in february 
we hope that the second report which the presidency will present on its own behalf at the second european council will if possible be more substantial and contain more specific points concerning the treaty texts 
we have taken note of the proposals put forward by the commission 
in our presidency capacity we welcome these proposals and they will be properly addressed in the discussions at this conference whatever each member state may think about the solutions the commission itself is putting forward in its proposal 
we hope that we will be able to include all the suggestions and documents that member states may send us on this matter 
in fact we shall be requesting the member states to provide us as quickly as possible with their contributions to this conference rather than have them arrive at the last moment 
of course the conference will always be open to suggestions from the member states but we would like them to state their positions as promptly as possible 
madam president ladies and gentlemen this is what we think the real work of this conference will be 
we are genuinely determined that where the intergovernmental conference is concerned the portuguese presidency should be exercised effectively and seriously 
we also hope to be able to hand over to the french presidency something tangible and as representative as possible of the links that may be established between the member states in the course of our work 
in helsinki the governments approved the idea that as long as the european union consists of fewer than states a minimal reform would be sufficient 
with more than a deeper reform would become necessary 
the european council in helsinki itself approved enlargement involving new member states 
it is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with countries while contemplating a minimal reform 
we are therefore thinking in terms of the treaty and we want the agenda of the next intergovernmental conference to allow for a deeper reform of the union 
having said this mr president this parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the conference 
in theory we could have done so 
we could have voted on the of this month and the conference would not have been able to start on the 
however we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place precisely in order to facilitate enlargement 
mr president i am very happy to be able to say this to the portuguese presidency because it has earned great respect in this assembly 
mr president i would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the european parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the european parliament itself 
however the european parliament will be reinforced politically by the treaty resulting from this intergovernmental conference 
this is for one very simple reason according to the agreements made in helsinki this intergovernmental conference will lead to issues which are currently decided unanimously being decided by a qualified majority 
therefore the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase 
it is already established within the community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with parliament 
therefore since the qualified majority will be extended there will also be more codecision with parliament 
however this parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supranational european institution if it did not consider the political design of the union 
that it is what we are doing 
we believe that in the political design of the union other issues need to be dealt with 
these include amongst others the incorporation into the treaty of security and defence issues which have made much progress recently but which must be incorporated into the treaty 
of course there is also the charter of fundamental rights and work began on its wording yesterday which i believe has started very positively 
therefore mr president our proposals which we will specify in another report together with the proposals of the commission which has produced an excellent document and i am happy to be able to say this here to mr barnier are going to be used as conference documents 
we will talk about this on another day 
mr president for the socialist group i can say we will be supporting the draft opinion put forward by the rapporteurs on behalf of the constitutional affairs committee 
we are giving a positive opinion on the convening of the igc precisely because we have been impressed by the attitude of the portuguese presidency which has taken on board our request that the agenda of the igc be widened 
the amsterdam leftovers is not a very good term because they are very important subjects in themselves 
let us call them the first three subjects of the igc 
these first three subjects are very important but they are subjects which were explored in detail by our member states during the last igc 
they did not quite reach a conclusion on them but they certainly do not need nine months of further study 
they need a political deal 
it is more a question of nine minutes perhaps nine hours if it is difficult locked away together in a room to reach a solution on these subjects not nine months 
in those circumstances it would be silly not to widen the agenda 
there are other issues that should fruitfully be looked at especially before such a large widening of the union to so many new countries 
nobody is asking for a christmas tree 
nobody is asking for an igc of the maastricht style with a hundred or more subjects being debated 
however there are six seven eight nine perhaps subjects which it would be very appropriate and useful to address 
there is time 
remember the igc that led to the single european act 
it lasted only five months 
the igc that led to the enormous maastricht treaty lasted a year 
only the amsterdam treaty lasted a year and a half and that was because everyone knew you had to wait for the results of the british election if you were going to have any outcome from that igc so that was a different reason 
a year is ample time to address a large number of issues and it should certainly be enough to address the few crucial points that we wish to be added to the agenda 
i am pleased to see that the commission shares our view 
the commission has just published its opinion and it has done exactly what parliament asked of it to bring forward a comprehensive proposal complete with actual draft treaty articles 
i thank the commission for doing that even if of course i do not agree with everything the commission said 
i think there are some gaps in what they have put forward 
nonetheless the commission has provided a service and i pay tribute to commissioner barnier who is here with us today for doing that 
they have laid out for the public to see some of the crucial issues that we are going to have to address in this igc 
that is all to the good 
the parliament the council presidency and the commission are pulling in the same direction for a wider agenda 
we should no longer be worried that the agenda for the igc will be restricted 
that is one of the political conclusions that we must draw from the grave decision of member states yesterday virtually to freeze relations with a partner 
it makes it impossible for those same member states at the igc to fail to give operational meaning to the protection and advancement of fundamental rights 
it is already strange within the convention that is drafting the charter to see representatives of some member states especially britain and france seeking to argue that a mandatory charter would somehow be an infringement of national sovereignty 
it is vital that the igc prepares the way to accept the installation of a fundamental rights regime within the treaty 
one part of this is to improve the access of the citizen to the court 
another is for the union itself to sign up to the european convention 
another is clearly for national parliaments and national political parties to find a reinforced role that they can play inside european union affairs and to share the shouldering of responsibility to build european parliamentary democracy 
my group strongly welcomes the igc and will be contributing to this treaty reform process to the maximum possible extent 
moreover given that this opinion is quite important we can still vote for it and indeed the majority of our group will be voting for it 
i nevertheless wish to stress the fact that it is quite distressing to see the lack of real interest in this reform 
the events in austria make it crystal clear that we need a body or structure for democracy in europe and we need to establish principles which provide bases all the member states 
it is also distressing to think that the initiative taken against austria is actually the result of an agreement between governments and that in any case the european union and its institutions would not have had the means or the consensus to allow them to act and to prevent and rectify the course of events 
we must take action on this at the intergovernmental conference and i firmly hope that this opinion that was given reluctantly will not mean that the european parliament ceases to exert pressure on the council and the member states to make sure that this intergovernmental conference is not merely a technical exercise but rouses the passions that we saw a few hours ago in parliament 
mr president mr president-in-office of the council commissioner to my mind it cannot be said often or loud enough that what the council has adopted in the way of an agenda for the intergovernmental conference is completely unacceptable politically and i would add that i consider it to be nothing short of disgraceful 
after all we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance that is to say we are negotiating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with states and together we have reached a stage at which closer european integration may be a reality in the not too distant future 
how though is the union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now i.e before enlargement takes place 
that is why we as a group are in favour of the intergovernmental conference 
we consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the european union in the not too distant future 
my group mr president-in-office of the council noted with satisfaction that the council presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs 
what we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of europe and in particular a europe that the citizens truly regard as being theirs because they are instrumental in shaping it and because the cares and concerns the problems and issues they face on a daily basis are also taken seriously by politicians 
the politics of closed doors and private discussions all that must be consigned to the past once and for all 
that is why we need transparency 
i believe it falls to you as president-in-office of the council to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were ignorant as to the content of the treaties 
we believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the intergovernmental conference is going and its outcome rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent 
we also take the view that the political decision-makers must at long last change the habit of a life-time and ask the citizens in referenda once the intergovernmental conference is over whether or not they go along with the way in which europe is to continue to develop in the future 
in this way europe would truly belong to the citizens and the union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy 
there is another central issue relating to democracy that i would like to make clear reference to 
as a member of the convention that has now taken up its work on the charter of fundamental rights i wish to make the following point clear neither my group nor i are content with making a solemn announcement about the charter 
after all what will the citizens say if we make a solemn announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals 
no to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the union 
the poor turnout at the european elections really should have been warning enough for everyone 
what we need are visible rights for each and every citizen the charter of fundamental rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the union 
together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens and what i expect to come out of the intergovernmental conference is that the relevant cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year 
of course we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a union of plus member states 
we will not achieve this just by undertaking a mini reform as the council has resolved to do and that is why all institutions must come under scrutiny 
we need bold change and at the same time we must take care to give the greatest possible attention to equal rights for the major and small states 
this is something i would stress particularly with my being an mep for one of the major member states 
i would like to thank the commission for the proposals they have put forward and i am certain that comprehensive discussions with the citizens will ensue here in the european parliament on all the issues you have raised 
there is one final issue i would like to raise 
it is indeed the case that globalisation of national economies but above all the introduction of the euro and the associated stability pact have led to a situation where we need to do more than analyse decision-making processes 
it is all about creating a socially just europe 
hence to my mind that includes having the courage to amend article of the ec treaty which defines the union in traditional neoliberal style as an open market economy with free competition 
the same applies to article in my view for the european central bank must at last be given the political task as enshrined in the treaty of using its monetary policy to promote sustained growth and employment 
mr president the union for a europe of nations group considers that the agenda for the forthcoming intergovernmental conference as set by the helsinki council i.e focussing strictly on the issue of decision making in an enlarged europe must be adhered to 
it must be adhered to in the interests of the fast effective work of the conference prior to enlargement 
this is why we cannot subscribe to either the opinion of the european parliament or indeed to that of the commission which both wish to widen this agenda far too much and what is more widen it in the wrong direction i.e moving towards centralisation and an ever tighter european system 
our group has therefore tabled a raft of amendments which when taken together form a real alternative resolution 
in them we say that the forthcoming igc must look into a decision-making system that pays greater attention to national sovereignty 
we deplore the fact that the commission in its opinion of january limits itself to following the routine path of a standardised europe enlarging towards the east a centralised superstate operating on the basis of majority decisions 
the federalists imagine that they are thereby going to create unity through constraint but this is a totally superficial concept 
quite the opposite in an enlarged europe mr president the standardisation imposed by the improper use of majority decisions can lead only to the whole thing exploding 
furthermore the centralised european system as we can see it developing today and as we can foresee it by extrapolation erodes nations and in eroding nations erodes the national patriotism which forms the basis of our will to defend ourselves 
the europe which results from this is not stronger but weaker as it no longer knows what it is or what it is defending 
this is why we have always said that enlargement was possible only if the diversity and freedom of the peoples of europe was clearly recognised i.e by adopting flexibility founded upon the respect of national sovereignty 
we are delighted today to see the progress this idea has enjoyed in certain circles one which are still unfortunately outside the european parliament and the commission 
a flexible europe is a europe which respects its national democracies which relies on the support of its nations its national patriotisms instead of continually persecuting them 
it is this that gives us the determination to defend ourselves against external threats not the constraining convoluted decision making procedures which the commission thought it could propose at the forthcoming intergovernmental conference 
it is no coincidence that the last intervention is the only one that was completely opposed to further european integration 
this is the message that parliament is sending to the council 
in any case tomorrow we shall vote against the igc agenda 
this message must be very clear this is how we explain the way we shall vote tomorrow 
we shall give an opinion which is technically and legally necessary on convening the igc on february but we shall give an unfavourable opinion of its content 
just consider the facts we looked at austria a while ago but we can also look at the stock markets mr president given that the euro that great undertaking has fallen % against the dollar in a year then perhaps i will not say a government but a good head of a family should ask himself whether one can conceivably tell the citizens that the only subjects open to negotiation are the number of commissioners or similar issues 
there is clearly a more ambitious goal 
we radicals have tabled amendments which we are submitting to the house in order to consolidate this text and for example to request just for the sake of mentioning articles and that the very minimum be done i.e that the european parliament should also be involved in drawing up the european constitution and that a proposal be made for the european parliament to adopt the amendments to the treaty 
we know that there are other topics for example many members have subscribed along with us to the issue of the seat of the institutions an issue that we believe should be considered at least at igc level 
in conclusion i hope that the message that we give tomorrow will be strong and wide-ranging for once so that thanks also to the efforts of the portuguese presidency this agenda will be revised 
otherwise the challenge really would be lost not just for the present but also for many years to come 
mr president the president of the commission was not being quite honest when he talked last week about the intergovernmental conference 
this means that it will be possible for major parts of the social systems in the member states to be changed by a majority in brussels even if a unanimous french national assembly a british house of commons and a dutch lower house should be against this 
these are matters which we ourselves shall no longer be able to decide upon as voters and no longer be able to change on election day 
brussels knows best 
mr prodi also announced greater transparency but his draft regulation signals a clear backward step and that is not only my assessment but also that of the european ombudsman 
there is also the desire to create a legal entitlement to confidentiality and to lock away documents of a kind which are at present publicly available in a range of member states 
under the banner of progress towards transparency a range of documents is being locked away from the general public 
it is of course thoroughly orwellian 
i want to ask mr prodi never more to comment on a proposal here in the house which is not at the same time available for critical scrutiny by the public 
there follows however a long long list of exceptions and there is legal entitlement to confidentiality in regard to those exceptions 
the french text contains the word refuse and the english text the word shall which means that the commission is to keep secret such information as is today available to the public for example in my own country 
in addition we have a flexible clause concerning the efficiency of the negotiations and of the institutions which may be used for any purposes whatsoever 
it is therefore 
we as a european parliament will use these opportunities to see that our issues are given the attention they deserve 
there is more to be said on that score 
it is crucially important for this intergovernmental conference to score a hat trick that of the power to act democratic legitimacy and transparency 
in the end it is only by having these three things in place that we will be able to achieve acceptance amongst the citizens 
at the same time of course we need to create the power to act in order to facilitate the enlargement of the european union 
if we have been having a different debate here in this chamber today then that only goes to show how important this is 
the european union must also have the power to act in the event of a government electing to impose a total blockade 
this is particularly important where enlargement is concerned and legislation and in relation to treaties which entail changes being made to legislation 
in addition we as a european parliament are going to have to take action in relation to economic and monetary union for there is a lack of supervision in this area 
the finance ministers behave as if they were in an intergovernmental meeting when in the ecofin council and in the euro council which is an unacceptable way to go on 
unlike mrs kaufmann i am not in favour of extending supervision over the european central bank as i am an advocate of independence for the european central bank 
however there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side 
furthermore the tripartite relationship of commission council and parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy where hitherto the council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case especially in relation to the crudely fashioned crisis management measures for which the commission alone has responsibility 
the overall plan failed to do justice to any of this 
we must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the intergovernmental conference 
the portuguese presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter perhaps to extend the mandate 
there is another point i would just like to draw your attention to 
i would urge those who are still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps pluck up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights 
the european union needs few if any new instruments and it does not need any new competences 
what it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice 
for this reason we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out on behalf of the citizens the tasks we have already formally been set in the treaty 
in my view that is the most important issue this intergovernmental conference has to concentrate its energies on 
if we succeed in making progress here then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the european union 
this is the crux of the matter 
mr president-in-office of the council i am confident that this will be tackled in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage 
chairman of the committee on constitutional affairs 
i can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this last week in the committee i chair but we eventually decided to back the portuguese presidency and we would like to win this wager 
you spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital cities and told us about the difficulties that some governments have in reaching a consensus in their own countries and therefore in their parliaments 
i would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we had a very worthwhile day of discussions and dialogue with the representatives of the national parliaments which were represented by competent and exacting delegations 
the aim was not to draw conclusions it was impossible to draw any but the debate was certainly very encouraging 
however we shall intensify our collaboration and our dialogue with the national parliaments for the entire duration of the intergovernmental conference 
yesterday we also discussed the commission represented by commissioner barnier who gave its opinion 
this effort was appreciated even if different views were later expressed as regards the proposals and moreover mr president-in-office you also expressed different views 
we must therefore ensure that at the intergovernmental conference we discuss how to consolidate the democratic bases of the union and how to strengthen and this has been discussed in the house even today with regard to the situation in austria the system of principles values and rights underpinning the union and the role of the political institutions of the union with regard among other things to running the economy 
we are counting on the portuguese presidency we are counting on ourselves and we are counting on the commission so that we can hold constructive and decisive debates on all of this at the intergovernmental conference 
mr president only a strengthened europe can cope with enlargement 
only a strengthened europe is immune to political opportunists who exploit dissatisfaction 
that is why sweeping reforms are necessary and hence a widened igc agenda 
the finnish presidency only listened to minimalist governments and unfortunately turned a deaf ear to this parliament 
it is of the utmost importance that the european parliament and the commission join forces for this igc 
in many ways they share the same interests and the same insights 
of all priorities this one is the most pressing 
it also means that our parliament president and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political footing and therefore not only within the working party but also at the same political level as the commission 
there is no reason whatsoever why representatives directly elected by citizens should be involved in talks at a lower level than the commission 
not only do we owe the sweeping reforms to the new member states but we owe them to ourselves 
if we allow europe to be watered down as a result of enlargement we will drown in our own political quagmire 
mr president there are days when i really cannot understand this parliament 
it seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation 
after having restricted on its own initiative its participation in the igc to two minor seats parliament is now giving up the right to add to the agenda for this igc 
the fact is whether through weakness or foolishness nothing to be proud of either way you will admit in rushing to give its opinion parliament is giving up the only lever which the treaty accords it i.e demanding a complete igc agenda as a prerequisite before declaring its opinion 
why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow february as a matter of urgency when we could wait in a position of strength until the opening of the strasbourg part-session on february and thus force an agenda that is complete and therefore consistent on the council 
a good dose of hypocrisy is needed to overlook our weakness today 
hypocrisy to be regretted bitterly in our resolution that the agenda for the igc is not equal to the issues since in our haste with blameworthy naivety we are stopping ourselves forcing through this more ambitious agenda 
if there is a democratic deficit at the end of this igc then i say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this 
whether we want it or not since parliament itself is going to extinguish the only spotlight capable of shedding a little light on the debates the venue for decisions is now going to move to the member states of the union 
i therefore invite the members of parliament who form the great majority those who last november ruled that the future of europe was deserving of debates that went far wider than the amsterdam leftovers to take up their pilgrims' staffs and go and convince their own governments that this igc must be extended since this is permitted according to the resolution of the helsinki council 
because of the situation in austria this is a dark day for europe 
it makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing 
in order to assert our fundamental values they need to be laid down in writing as a matter of urgency and beyond this igc i believe we owe europe a constitution 
mr president the draft resolution we are now discussing requires precisely as before that the forthcoming intergovernmental conference should have a broad agenda involving radical reforms of the institutions 
the forthcoming enlargement of the union is used as an argument for this 
i am convinced that this is an error of judgement 
a federal and centralist eu which intervenes more and more in the government of the member states is in actual fact less well placed for enlargement 
a flexible eu which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries 
paragraph d of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at eu level 
it is not however possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union 
this text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the european central bank 
this is untenable 
if there is a desire to make the eu more democratic the whole construction of emu must be reconsidered 
the central bank must be placed under political control so that the direction to be taken by monetary policy may be governed by political objectives such as high employment and prosperity 
public control of the central bank must be improved if this is to become possible 
the rigid and unsuccessful monetarism of the stability pact must be re-examined and discarded so that we might have a uniform policy which has prosperity as its primary objective 
article of the treaty prohibiting currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital must be removed so that damaging currency speculation may be checked by means of political control 
in the majority of eu countries there are now governments dominated by social democrats 
it is remarkable that now they have the opportunity to do so none of them is demanding any change in the direction taken by monetary union 
it also of course damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalised capital 
the resolution requires the european parliament to have increased influence over the intergovernmental conference 
it is however important to emphasise that the intergovernmental conference is and will remain a conference of the member states 
it is the member states' parliaments or people voting in referenda who are to direct the development of the treaty 
it is therefore out of the question that the european parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification 
mr president the committee on constitutional affairs has proposed an essentially positive text which i shall vote for even if i personally had proposed a lot of amendments to broaden it 
nevertheless the events of the last few days show that all those who had made basic criticisms of the way enlargement and the revision of the treaties have been planned were right 
the union cannot be enlarged to without addressing the matter of whether europe has certain joint principles and values whether it comes down to an economic free trade area or whether on the other hand it has a greater ambition the desire to be a supranational union in ways that have yet to be defined that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world 
this is what is and was meant by the call for a european constitution 
the amendment of the treaties was however limited to a review of some internal rules which was necessary and important but did not answer the fundamental question what is europe what are its common principles and therefore its objectives and limitations 
however politics exacts its revenge and having been thrown out of the window by a debate on a limited agenda it comes back in as a matter of fact through a door and through the front door in the case of austria since a party is entering the austrian government which seems to represent a return to intolerance xenophobia and forms of racism 
and it is not a question of links with the past it is a question of prospects for the future and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this 
i belong to a world the world of liberal catholics which is not left-wing but which holds as dear as anyone else the values of tolerance and common european values and will have nothing to do with policies that reject these values 
the council has done well to lay open this subject to europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a charter of fundamental rights in a european constitution then we shall construct a europe without a solid lasting base 
commissioner barnier i know at least i think i know that you and the representatives of the portuguese presidency share these values make the most of the chances you were given by the december conference to include these subjects and principles because this is the only way we will build a lasting europe 
mr president i am in the happy position of being able to refer to a couple of striking contributions from a small group of nordic sceptics and opponents of the drastic and growing integration process which looked long and hard at threatens the whole of democratic europe 
i am thinking of the contributions from mr bonde and mr sjöstedt who point out that the present contribution contains a string of relatively unconscious but undoubtedly rational initiatives dictated by the desire for power and pointing in the direction of a centralist and federalist eu 
they rightly included the problem with monetary union and centralist government and presented a number of alternative democratic principles 
i might add that all rational political campaigning in my own country denmark takes it for granted that when we enlarge the circle of eu countries to include the envisaged huge number of new member states and when we in that way extend the breadth of the union we cannot at the same time pursue further integration in depth that is to say engage in a more intensive qualitative integration towards a united states of europe 
however that is precisely what is happening 
with every single geographical extension to the area covered by the eu we have seen how extensions in breadth have been followed by intensive extensions in depth and that is precisely what the draft resolution from the committee is contemplating especially in paragraph which says that there should be more thorough integration in depth 
when we hold intergovernmental conferences and consider changes to the treaty we must take into account the fact that the eu is developing all the time sometimes in contravention of the treaty as we have just seen 
i welcome commissioner barnier and the portuguese presidency here this afternoon 
on february we will see the launch of the igc which is to be completed by the end of 
this is a big task but it can be done 
i think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare europe for enlargement 
in other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important amsterdam leftovers 
these include the extension of qualified voting in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation the re-weighting of voting in council to favour larger states and the number of commissioners in an enlarged europe 
in relation to the latter point ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal member of the commission irrespective of the number of member states joining 
we are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the council of ministers provided that the larger member states are willing to agree to every member state having a full and equal member of the commission 
i feel i speak for many smaller countries when i make that particular point 
at the igc we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the treaties into two into a policy area and an area on the constitution 
we would accept the division of the treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller member states had in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the treaty 
in other words if we are not represented fully in the commission we will not have an input into policy discussions 
so we are watching that entire point extremely carefully 
we look forward to the charter of fundamental rights and to seeing its contents 
the treaty of amsterdam mr president has set the number of european parliament members at and a debate is needed in this parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged europe 
in any case this emerges from the favourable schedule we decided upon 
i think that under the present rules of the treaties the european parliament would have little to gain from a policy of confrontation 
on the contrary we should concentrate on working out persuasive proposals on the necessary reforms in collaboration with the commission whose own proposals are worthy of note 
we must use dialogue at every political level including of course dialogue with the national parliaments 
that way we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reforms 
they must therefore realise that such issues cannot be decided on the rationale of bargaining alone 
the issues to be dealt with at this intergovernmental conference are exceptionally sensitive 
it may be easy to come up with solutions but what matters is how well those solutions will stand up in the long term 
i will mention two point that may create tension 
one is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries 
europe is not nor can it become a classic federal state 
the solutions we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the european union which is a union of states and peoples 
the other area of conflict is more difficult 
owing to the imminent increase in membership the bodies of the future european union must become more effective 
this means that they must function more simply and more rapidly 
by its very nature however the european union is and will remain a complex and convoluted multi-governmental institution 
possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist 
of course they do but they are not unlimited 
if the limits are exceeded because of a one-sided quest for effectiveness then the legitimising basis of the european union will suffer 
i am however optimistic 
mr president the intergovernmental conference mandate needs to be widened 
the most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the union 
it is unfortunate that there has been no serious consideration thus far here in parliament of the issue of internal differentiation within the union which will however be necessary if the union is to enlarge as planned 
he has also said that the countries in the vanguard of integration should be able to proceed faster and that they should have their own institutions for the sake of clarity 
last november the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party adopted a position on internal differentiation within the union when it proposed a system of concentric rings for europe the onion skin model 
in the next resolution on the igc parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility 
both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings as proposed by the group of the european liberal democrats and reform party 
my colleagues mrs frassoni and mr onesta have already spoken somewhat sceptically about some aspects of the matter in hand 
i wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity not just between union and member states but between member states and their own internally self-governing regions 
this has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about 
may i particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this parliament 
a ceiling of has been prescribed as the maximum that parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly 
if you apply the existing principle of digressive proportionality six seats for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitants you already have the situation where luxembourg with people has more members in this chamber than wales which is a partly self-governing region of the united kingdom 
scotland with a population of million has eight seats in this house at the moment denmark and finland with the same population have sixteen 
now what is going to happen if we retain a ceiling of bring in % more population over time and then adopt the commission' s i think ill-considered proposition that there should be a european list of candidates 
what will happen to a place like scotland which i represent here 
it will become totally invisible 
members of this house should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions people in scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new member states from within existing ones 
a growing body of opinion in scotland holds that view 
we are not discussing the substance of the agenda that is the items already included or those that we all wish to see included 
we are stating the political position of the european parliament on convening the intergovernmental conference 
there is nothing new here apart from one aspect the fact that with this opinion assuming it is approved tomorrow the european parliament is adopting a positive strategy to assist in widening the igc agenda 
this also demonstrates its willingness to contribute by means of its two representatives and its president to reaching a more satisfactory final solution to this revision of the treaty 
this opinion is positive about the convening of the igc and yet critical as it would inevitably have to be about the substance of this agenda 
the constitutional framework has now been clarified 
therefore mr president and my dear friend dr seixas da costa my question is this without wishing to know more than we need to at the moment in order not to compromise our common goal i would like to know from the contacts you have made during your tour of the capitals and from your own point of view if there is any useful information you could give us 
i ask this because at the moment our lobbying work is more important than our work within the european parliament 
this involves raising the awareness of the governments that are most reluctant to include further items on this igc agenda and persuading them to do so 
my second question is for commissioner barnier 
i was one of its critics as i felt that the commission should have gone further at the helsinki european council 
i also feel however that the commission did an excellent job whether or not you agree with the solutions put forward in the document adopted on january 
however why is the commission concentrating only on the amsterdam leftovers or perhaps on some other point 
why is it confining itself to stating that other issues could be included specifically the charter of fundamental rights or common foreign and security policy issues 
i would therefore challenge the commission to move forward and to begin at least by providing alternatives to work on these other points which will perhaps later on form part of the agenda and contribute to its success 
it could do this in the same thorough way in which it has worked on the proposals we are already familiar with 
i shall finish by offering my warmest congratulations to the portuguese presidency 
they do not have an easy task but i know that it is in safe hands 
mr president to say that the european union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new 
it has been said many times 
this time however it is true 
we have established the single currency which is extremely positive and we are facing enlargement 
the question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not 
will we enlarge with or without deep reform 
that is the debate and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the intergovernmental conference its agenda or its method 
it is clear that the council for the moment has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place 
that puts enlargement in danger 
it jeopardises any prospect of political union and of course it is difficult for the public to understand 
the council must realise that if we want the future of the european union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations the next intergovernmental conference must go much further 
the council is consulting us and parliament is giving its opinion 
we want an intergovernmental conference but not this one 
must there be an igc 
of course there must but not this type of intergovernmental conference 
the agenda must go much further 
we must be much more daring with regard to the issues dealt with in the igc and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic 
being much more democratic means greater participation by the european parliament and allowing the commission to exercise even more yes more its ability to take the initiative 
we must clearly set firm objectives 
the functionalist approach is over for better or for worse 
the functionalist approach has brought us to this point 
have we achieved results 
yes but the point is to make a qualitative leap and speaking in political terms this mr president-in-office of the council means convincing the other community partners that to fall short would be the worst thing we could do at the moment 
mr president ladies and gentlemen of the house at this stage following this debate which i have listened to most attentively and with great interest i should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of president prodi 
mr president ladies and gentlemen in the report which they produced after extremely thorough and meticulous work your two rapporteurs mr dimitrakopoulos and mr leinen proposed that parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to article of the treaty and thus if this opinion were adopted the intergovernmental conference could effectively start on february as suggested by the portuguese presidency 
as far as we are concerned after producing the opinion expected from the commission according to this same article of the treaty we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated 
we know i know myself that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us 
i would just like to make a few comments after reading the draft opinion and after listening to the speakers on behalf of the various groups 
firstly ladies and gentlemen the commission understands the anxiety expressed by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda 
i understand this anxiety this fear that the agenda may be too limited and yet i feel as i said to the committee on constitutional affairs on returning from helsinki that we can work on the basis of this helsinki mandate 
indeed it is in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate which the commission framed for its own opinion but using all the terms thereof plus everything between the lines 
we have not restricted ourselves to the three so-called leftovers which is in any case an incorrect label 
it gives the impression that they are three minor or insignificant subjects whereas in fact they are three extremely serious and important subjects and difficult so difficult that we did not have sufficient political courage collectively at amsterdam to deal with them in depth 
as far as we are concerned i am responding to mr seguro who expressed concerns about this just now we have not restricted ourselves to these three subjects even though i do consider them as priorities and consider that they must be dealt with now 
they are the first but they are not the only subjects mr seguro that the conference must deal with 
we have dealt with other subjects and we have mentioned our idea that other subjects may be dealt with in this conference if the portuguese presidency firstly and then the french presidency so wish in view of the serious nature of the present juncture prior to enlargement 
we are ready for it whether it is a matter of the charter of fundamental rights on which work has started the cfsp and the consequences for the institutions of the current defence policy negotiations or an extremely difficult subject on which we are continuing to work reorganisation of the treaties 
this proves that it is possible to go into issues in depth while respecting this mandate by using the terms laid down in the mandate and all the openings which it offers 
as regards the participation of the european parliament in the conference proceedings i think that mr seixas da costa will agree with me on the basis of our shared experience in saying that you would be wrong to disregard the level of the reflection and negotiating group in which your two representatives professor tsatsos and mr brok are going to be working 
of course the final trade-offs will be made as in any institutional negotiations and i think this is no bad thing at council level especially at the level of the council of heads of state and government who hold the key to the success of this conference in their hands 
let me point out in passing that the commission president mr prodi is also a council member and he has every intention of making use of this position and this role alongside the heads of state and government particularly during the final period 
however these council proceedings must be carefully prepared 
this preparatory work this fine-tuning must not be omitted ladies and gentlemen of the house 
i know from my own experience in amsterdam that it is extremely important and useful and that it will not just be limited to technical details 
i think that all of us the personal representatives of the ministers of foreign affairs your two representatives and myself as a representative of the commission will be going into matters in detail but it will be afterwards at a different level one in which we will also be participating that the last trade-offs must be made 
throughout this conference ladies and gentlemen it is not only the status of the negotiators which is important but the quality of what they will be saying 
and once again i should like to point out in this house in view of my own experience prior to amsterdam that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status acknowledged to the two representatives of the european parliament prior to amsterdam the quality of what mrs guigou and mr brok said counted for a lot in these negotiations 
i am sure that the situation will be just the same and as far as i am concerned in my current position i shall ensure that the contributions of your two representatives are listened to and respected throughout these negotiations 
i am sure that in this way the european parliament will not be just an observer at these negotiations any more than the commission will be 
it is extremely important that the two european institutions involved in these negotiations the commission on the one hand and parliament on the other alongside the council members explain clearly to the citizens of the union continually every day what the issues of this conference are and what responses we advocate in our capacity as european institutions responsible for ensuring both the proper operation of this enlarged union and the common interest 
in the coming months ladies and gentlemen of the house the commission will therefore be working in close cooperation on good terms with your two representatives professor tsatsos and mr elmar brok in order to reconcile our points of view if need be 
quite probably our points of view and our positions will not always be the same 
there will probably be differences of opinion that would be only normal 
the important thing is that we are consistent and i have been committed to working towards this consistency ever since i accepted the position of commissioner 
our concern and our ambition therefore on a large number of subjects is to be on the same wavelength and to carry these negotiations forward successfully 
this will not be a matter of chance since let me repeat i feel we have the same ambitions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the european union 
finally i should like to make three additional comments quite briefly mr president 
firstly to congratulate and thank mr napolitano the chairman and the committee on constitutional affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments the committee on constitutional affairs and the commission for an initial joint debate 
such dialogue between the national parliaments the european parliament and ourselves is extremely important 
i have said furthermore that i would play my part by visiting each of the national parliaments 
tomorrow i shall be in london 
in three weeks' time i shall be in paris and i shall continue this dialogue in one capital after another 
i feel this initiative you have taken is extremely positive and i should like to thank you for taking it 
my second brief comment is to thank the portuguese presidency particularly mr seixas da costa for his proactive approach 
indeed the comments which have just been made express a proactive attitude and a concern which match his own the portuguese presidency cannot be just an interim presidency 
it will have to initiate these negotiations 
we are well aware that they cannot be completed within these six months and that it will have to hand over to the french presidency in the hope that a conclusion can be reached before the end of the year 
not only that a conclusion can be reached but that a successful conclusion can be reached which is not necessarily the same thing 
concluding negotiations is not the same as concluding them successfully 
the handover will have been made but the conditions in which the handover is going to be made by yourself mr president and by the portuguese presidency are going to be extremely important as is the nature of this handover 
it is all the work which is going to be carried out together under your guidance particularly in the course of these few months which is extremely important 
portugal is a small country but being a small country is no reason why one may not have great ambitions 
after having heard prime minister guterres the minister of foreign affairs and yourself i have confidence in the ambition of the portuguese presidency and the extremely proactive way in which it will conduct these negotiations 
it can count on the partnership of the commission over the next few months 
finally let me repeat we shall have a very great effort to make in order to popularise the topics of these negotiations 
these are difficult subjects subjects relating to institutional policy and mechanisms which are not always easy to explain 
all the more reason for members of the european parliament ministers commissioners to devote a little time to explaining matters to the citizens to public debate 
as far as the commission is concerned it will ladies and gentlemen be taking initiatives to inaugurate and orchestrate this public debate 
i would first like to say how indebted i am to the commission for seizing the initiative and for the two draft directives we are discussing here today 
it has thereby succeeded in closing two serious loopholes in the internal market which are of great significance to the european economy and to million third-country nationals in the european union who are here as workers or on a self-employed basis 
the current state of play and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again is that there are in fact judgements from the european court of justice relating to employees i refer in particular to those relating to the rush portuguesa case and that of van der elst 
these have in fact clarified that the freedom to provide services must allow for third-country nationals to be taken on as employees of cross-border services and this without having to obtain work permits 
however the european court of justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the member states were unable to clarify this issue 
the situation as far as self-employed people are concerned is that current community invested legal rights do not afford third-country nationals the right to provide cross-border services 
there is no doubt that we need a legislative act here 
both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for eu enterprises 
it is not about establishing original rights for third-country nationals modelled on freedom of movement 
all provisions i.e issues relating to entry into the eu and to the law pertaining to residence rights should be regarded as ancillary to this freedom to provide services 
many of our amendments relate back to concerns that were also voiced in the council and we are attempting to reconcile these concerns with the task that falls to us by dint of extant law and economic good sense 
when it comes to acceptance by the council i can only urge the commission to adopt as many of the amendments adopted by parliament as possible even if some of them deviate substantially from the original commission proposals 
i am absolutely convinced that it will be easier for us to achieve consensus in the council on this basis 
turning now to the most important of our proposed amendments one of the essential differences is that in place of a service provision card plus notification for each individual contract system provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous notification from the receiving state for each individual contract 
this system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms 
an individual is required to be in authorised employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of validity and for three months thereafter 
this should serve as a guarantee for the receiving state that the employee or self-employed person will return to the sending state once the contract is completed and that they will be covered under insurance law in the event of illness or accident 
likewise the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued namely under the terms of an opposition procedure 
what we are proposing is that it should not just be a case of having to apply for the eu service provision card for all member states rather one should also have the option of applying for it for individual member states 
i believe this system is also more suited to practical needs 
i would hope that the same holds true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three months and to be flexible in adapting the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting 
however we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be months 
when it comes to self-employed persons in addition to the amendments already described we propose that the domicile criteria should be made more stringent and that we should make provision for the possibility of countering any abuse in the way of bogus self-employment 
i would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market 
i have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting council decisions 
two amendments were cancelled by the services because the content has supposedly already been given consideration to in the report 
i withdraw the two other amendments that is amendment no to the report on self-employed persons and amendment no on employed persons 
i can only urge the conference of presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of comitology i.e the correct way to quote 
unfortunately i have to say that i am unable to support this proposed amendment because it in fact changes the substance of the outcome that we in the committee on legal affairs and the internal market resolved on unanimously and i would like to stand by this outcome which we arrived at together after lengthy discussions 
on a final note i would like to thank all those in the committee who supported me in compiling these reports which were far from easy to produce 
i would like to single mr wieland out for special mention for he has the dubious honour of being the shadow rapporteur and was involved to a far greater extent than is customary in the drawing up of this report contributing excellent and constructive ideas and this without being in a position to receive the plaudits awarded a rapporteur 
that is why he deserves special mention 
 
if you allow me mr president i would like to go into the different amendments in more detail at the end of the debate 
i am extremely grateful for the work that mrs berger has put into these proposals which are politically sensitive and which constitute a legislative challenge 
i would also thank mrs palacio most warmly for her major contribution as chairman of the committee on legal affairs and the internal market 
the commission particularly welcomes the suggestions made by parliament for a more efficient procedure for the issue of service provision cards 
if the opportunity is created to apply for service provision cards for one or more or all member states the procedure would be more flexible still 
the commission also supports the proposed flexible period of validity of the card 
however i do not consider a three-month period of employment to be sufficient to prove that an employee is resident in a member state 
the commission also agrees with a provision for cases in which the contract of employment between the service provider and his employer is terminated at short notice 
an efficient procedure for issuing cards implies that companies which provide cross-border services can also exercise their rights in concrete terms on the basis of the internal market 
it seems over the top to us for other member states to be given the option of systematically carrying out inspections systematically with a view to safeguarding public order before they issue cards 
indeed it should be possible for a third-country subject who has legal status in a member state to be admitted to other member states too 
that does not prevent these member states from taking public-order measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification 
neither does the commission accept the proposal that legal status in a member state should be valid three months after the card has expired 
following completion of the service it is not acceptable for the third-country subject in question to remain any longer in the member state in which the service is provided 
as far as the second proposal is concerned the commission appreciates the wish that it should be clear what is meant by someone who is self-employed and would therefore like to resolve this issue in the amended proposal 
these are a few introductory remarks concerning the key amendments 
i hope that at the end of the debate when all the speakers have contributed i will once again be given the opportunity to elaborate upon the different amendments 
mr president tomorrow will see a large majority within the ppe group vote in favour of the amendments put forward by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market as well as the amended version 
i propose to confine my comments to two areas 
firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve that is achieve in the real sense 
there is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account 
my comments start from the premise that we are talking about an upright individual in gainful employment 
then there are the interests of the member states which being on the receiving end may have to start from the premise of a worst case scenario 
if we are going to abide by the one extreme that is the interests of the member states then we certainly have every reason to make the hurdles that have to be cleared in applying for this card relatively high 
there is also an argument for introducing early notification obligations as well as having this card 
if i were to go to the other extreme as few hurdles as possible that is then i would run the risk of failing to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the member states would not sign up to this directive 
i would therefore end up with a situation where a directive on the service provision card might well be in place but with the hurdles facing the business world being so high in reality no one would apply for the card 
alternatively i might have no directive at all 
neither outcome would be satisfactory 
perhaps this is also why as is rumoured to be the case the council has become bogged down in its negotiations on this as well 
we have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest that of public order and the other that of finding the easiest possible solution 
we want to arrive at a solution where certain hurdles are created vis-à-vis the business world but once these have been overcome implementation is as easy as it possibly could be 
therefore we want applications for the service provision card to be for one or more member states 
if a company in france says that it has an employee who has to work in denmark on a permanent basis and only in denmark then it certainly ought only to be possible to apply for this card for denmark 
accordingly the bureaucratic hurdles that have to be overcome would be lower in this instance 
consequently i too have to say that i am in favour of the amendments put forward by the committee on legal affairs and the internal market 
perhaps there was a certain amount of residual misunderstanding on the part of the commission 
we want to achieve a completely flexible solution 
if a particular member state was to declare that it had suddenly run into problems because the individual concerned had committed a theft and the card was for their country then this particular member state would be able to revoke this card as it were for the reasons cited in this directive which is altogether a flexible and intelligent solution 
allow me just to go very briefly into a second matter 
most of those who have been working on the directive to date have been lawyers 
we all know that there are still various parts of the treaty some of them very old which are still referred to as ec 
we are aware that this directive is founded on ec law and not on eu law 
however before the elections we the council the commission parliament the press unions and companies that is worked towards making the europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizens 
we have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from eec to ec to eu 
they have now got to grips with eu 
we would be doing neither ourselves nor the citizens any favours if we were to christen the product we are proposing to deliver ec service provision card and not eu service provision card 
it is the world of the eu that the citizens are interested in this is the one that counts in their eyes 
i would urge the council and the commission to move in this direction 
mr president it is later than any of us thought it would be when we were planning for this session so i shall be very brief indeed 
one of the reasons why we are late is because we spent time earlier today rightly stating the rooted opposition of this parliament to any form of xenophobia or racism 
this directive is of course not in itself directly about that 
it is about attending to the needs of the internal market creating flexibility and behaving in a reasonable and flexible way to enable the employment of third country persons both as employees and self-employed 
that is in itself also about avoiding being unduly restrictive towards the stranger simply because he or she is a stranger 
we welcome that and because we think it makes a sensible and proper provision we will support the most liberal version which we understand to be consistent with the law 
mr president commissioner i would firstly like to highlight the excellent work carried out by mrs berger and the committee on legal affairs and the internal market generally which has incorporated innovative ideas into this directive which i hope will be approved by the commission and the council 
nevertheless i have tabled an amendment 
mrs berger in your amendment no to recital you mention legal security 
the first point on which we disagree is the duration of three months for the residency permit since all that does is create legal insecurity 
you rightly raise the concern also expressed by mr wieland at the possibility of workers disappearing into thin air when their work permits expire but i think that we would be making this even more likely by bringing in a three month permit 
if the validity of the service provision card expires on a certain date it must end on that date 
legal security requires this 
on the other hand with regard to point d of amendment no which refers to the first directive you suggest that for reasons of public security or public order regulations a member state may reject the validity of the card 
there are already some ex ante controls laid down in article of the directive 
it makes no sense for any worker within the schengen area since he or she will already have undergone a screening process in order to enter the first member state and the second member state would be justified in rejecting ex ante the entry of that worker into its territory 
it therefore makes no sense to maintain that legal insecurity 
in the case of a non-schengen state in the last paragraph of amendment no that possibility is contemplated and is perfectly expressed and i believe this provides greater legal security 
the discretional power of the state which you propose in point e of your amendment no seems to me to be inconsistent with the rest of your excellent report 
i would therefore ask members to examine my amendment carefully and i hope that tomorrow we will achieve a result 
on the face of it these two proposals appear to be implementing certain procedural changes to facilitate freedom of movement across europe and to give effect to the recent court cases mrs berger referred to in her opening remarks 
however in the case of the united kingdom we believe they go further than that in a manner which is unacceptable 
partly this is substance and partly it is in respect of the legal base in regard to the special position of the united kingdom 
under the arrangements contained in the treaties the united kingdom retains its border controls 
under the system proposed in these pieces of legislation third country nationals wishing to move to the uk under the procedures described will do so by virtue of the service provision card issued by another member state thereby by-passing uk border controls 
if there is to be a change to the present united kingdom border arrangements that change should be made by the united kingdom government and the united kingdom parliament and not en passant by the european legislative process 
for that reason we shall vote against both these proposals 
mr president commissioner first and foremost i would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur and to mr wieland for the efforts they have expended in summing up the various proposed amendments and interests in this report in such a balanced manner 
these two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services 
the new regulation for cross-border services will doubtless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprises 
the strict basic conditions attached to the issue of the eu service provision card and i am with mr wieland on this are essential for they will serve to prevent abuses such as illegal entry and bogus contracts 
why do i think we need the directive so much 
three reasons and they are as follows on account of the economic importance of third-country workers in the eu in the interests of the competitiveness of enterprises and the proper functioning of the internal market 
therefore whilst i welcome the strict basic conditions i would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the member states to be made as effective and simple as possible 
my last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and is therefore addressed to the commission 
will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations 
how is article to be interpreted and explained in your view as this will have important implications notably for the accession negotiations and for our country which shares common borders with so many applicant countries 
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen businesspeople have so far had to live with the fact that two of the key freedoms namely the free movement of people and services did not apply to them 
indeed they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the member states where a service had to be provided 
there are approximately thirteen million third-country subjects who reside within european territory 
i assume that although the exact number of businesspeople included in this figure is not known their number will most definitely not be low 
so up to now their access to the entire territory of the union has not been regulated by community legislation 
the aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introducing the eu service provision card 
i have also paid close attention to the concerns raised by the commissioner 
having also studied the amendments submitted i concluded that we can go along with these concerns to a large extent and that this will be reflected in our voting behaviour tomorrow 
may i to finish off thank mrs berger for the great care she has taken in studying the different amendments and for having in that way added an important degree of meaning to her report 
i think that with this report we are once again one step closer to the realisation of the internal market 
mr president thank you very much for the opportunity you are giving me to go into the different amendments in more detail 
in the course of my speech i would also like to address lord inglewood regarding the remark he has just made 
regarding the first proposal on third-country employees the commission is prepared to adopt amendments nos and 
amendments nos and are acceptable too provided the situation of posting is established in the member state in which the service provider is established 
the commission also agrees with amendment no except for the proposed period of previous employment of only three months as i explained just now 
in terms of comitology amendments nos and also apply in part insofar as the rights of parliament are concerned 
i regret that the commission has found amendment no to be unacceptable as far as the three-month period and the role of the member state in which the service is provided are concerned 
in this respect the commission supports amendment no as i have already mentioned 
the other amendments are unacceptable 
personally i am rather in favour of the term eu service provision card which is proposed in amendment no but the treaty of amsterdam does not allow this 
acceptance of amendment no by the commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued 
surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the member states 
amendment no is also unacceptable given my thoughts on amendment no 
the commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal 
i would like to add that amendment no to that proposal is wholly acceptable 
as far as amendment no on the definition of the term self-employed is concerned the commission will as i have already remarked provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objections lodged 
he referred to united kingdom border controls and i would like to say to him that member states and this includes the united kingdom are under no obligation at all to abolish or change controls at the existing borders 
this applies as already stated to the united kingdom and it also applies to belgium where it was recently of relevance 
with regard to the remark made by mr karas i am under the impression that he is talking about the possibility of people from poland being used as employees in his country 
the commission would like to propose finding a solution to this problem which would then apply to all companies based in the european union which employ staff from non-eu countries 
the question is furthermore one of whether the two cases should be treated in the same way 
in my opinion this is an issue which belongs to the debate on the enlargement of the european union and perhaps not to the present debate 
on behalf of the commission i would be more than happy to make myself available to mr karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point 
i will keep myself free in this connection 
finally i would like to thank parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspects of these proposals and in particular of course the rapporteur mrs berger 
thank you very much commissioner bolkestein 
the debate is closed 
the vote will take place tomorrow at a.m 
ii 
the idea of including this issue on the agenda we are discussing today was still on the agenda of the helsinki summit is still being advocated by various member states and by the courts themselves and is being kept alive in the european parliament whose committee on legal affairs and the internal market is preparing what i think will be a high-quality opinion on the nature and the extent of judicial reform 
these are that justice must be done more quickly that we need to establish the legal bases for an area of freedom security and justice and finally that we need to move beyond a commercial and economic conception of europe 
this will convince the public that they are part of a legal community which is based on democratic law and on the courts and which respects their fundamental ethical and legal values and protects their interests even when the force of national law is not sufficient to guarantee them full citizenship 
the truth is that these fundamental reasons for a thorough reform of the entire community judicial system also explain the possible reform of the court of first instance which we are discussing today although that has a different legal basis namely the treaty of amsterdam 
these reasons do however justify such a reform particularly two or three of them which i shall now mention 
the last reason is that this court the court of first instance is the only instance to which individuals and companies have recourse on economic disputes with regard to decisions by the bodies which affect them 
the second reform proposed concerns an increase in the jurisdiction of the court of first instance which at present only covers actions for annulment by private individuals but which will then also cover actions brought by member states 
i am talking here about potential actions by the member states concerning transport policy competition rules applicable to undertakings state aids trade protection measures the application of funds and other action programmes under which the community grants financial assistance particularly concerning proceedings relating to fraud against the community budget 
when member states accept the possibility of an appeal to the court of first instance involving proceedings on the same matter as an action already brought by a private individual the court will be able to establish what appeals a member state has lodged 
this will put member states and private individuals on an equal footing in the way the court functions 
mr president some people will call this a lightweight reform but the fact is that it is an achievable reform based on standards which make it permissible under the treaty of amsterdam 
it is basically the reform envisaged and requested by the court of the european communities itself independently of the igc and on the basis of the treaty currently in force 
i believe particularly because there was such considerable consensus within the committee that parliament will agree to these two proposals and that it will give the court its vote 
we can only hope that the council will do the same 
my last hope is that the court will make the best possible use of its new powers the new jurisdiction which this parliament has not a moment too soon decided to grant it 
for this reason i would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by vice-president marinho 
mr president the reform of the community judicial system has become an essential requirement if in the future we intend justice to be done within reasonable time scales and if in the future the european union wishes to have a judicial system which is equal to the political project which we have embarked upon 
today and i must say this with pride and satisfaction this parliament has had a good opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which we europeans believe that the european political project is much more than just an internal market and that it is based much more on principles than on economic interests 
behind these principles mr president lies the justice system 
however justice delayed is justice denied and we must reflect on this notion 
the working document prepared by the court itself contains alarming information 
for this reason the draft reform which has been drawn up by the rapporteur vice-president marinho is to be welcomed 
it is true that it is a stopgap solution but we must rely on stopgap solutions because at the moment as he himself has pointed out we cannot expect a broad reform of the system from the intergovernmental conference 
we have to offer solutions which while provisional help to provide a faster and more effective system of justice 
the first is that greater resources should be given to judges of first instance and that they should be given one more référendaire 
the second is that the translation services of the court of first instance and the court of justice should be separated 
at the moment the court of first instance has to wait a very long time for its judgements to be translated 
according to the treaty one of the founding principles of this community is linguistic and cultural plurality and there is no question of our overlooking the possibility of something as important as being able to read a judgement in our own language 
since we are talking about the intergovernmental conference let us consider just two points 
the first concerns this parliament 
i believe that it is well worth insisting that we wish to participate more with regard to the court of justice even in the appointment of judges 
above all we wish to see an extension of the competences of the court of justice hand in hand with its capacity to fulfil its obligations in other words its resources 
we wish to see its competences extended especially within chapter iv of the treaty of the european community and with regard to chapter vi of the treaty on european union and also a review of certain possible options certain clear limitations of protection in these areas which are of extraordinary importance to our citizens 
and i refer once again to the declarations which we have heard in recent days 
mr president i would like to congratulate the rapporteur and welcome the contents of this report 
it has caused me to reflect on two problems which have come to me recently in my own constituency 
both concern cases with decisions pending before the court of justice 
the first relates to a large suspension bridge and whether or not tolls on it should be subject to vat 
the decision could have huge implications for our local economy 
secondly there is a lady within thirteen weeks of retirement who is desperate for news of a decision that will affect seriously her financial circumstances in old age 
delays in justice can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy 
this is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the european court 
amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references 
the proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim palliative but europe is a legal construction its courts are central to its proper functioning 
in the face of coming enlargement the igc must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system 
otherwise we will all as elected representatives be faced with more and more clamour from our citizens who are not getting access to quick and effective justice 
mr president i too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report 
i also fully endorse his findings in which in particular he suggests increasing the number of consultants for judges at the court of first instance and providing the latter with its own translation service 
however i also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here 
for example i believe it is worth considering making the court of first instance that of last instance if applicable and making this a final competence in those spheres where benches of the court which resemble courts pass judgement at a preliminary stage i need only mention the keyword alicante or whatever the plans are for european civil service law 
it seems to me that we need to give this some thought as these cases will no longer fall to the court of first instance of course but to the court of justice as draft decisions 
we need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind 
where possible one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the court of first instance 
in addition we must consider whether it is right and proper and we have already had cases in which meps not to mention groups lodged a complaint against the european parliament for the court of first instance to be responsible for such cases when in fact matters of a constitutional nature are affected and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the court of justice than before the court of first instance 
on a final note i too believe that olaf requires monitoring under rule of law 
as things stand olaf is in a vacuum and can do as it pleases 
it is essential for olaf to be monitored by a court 
the only court that could reasonably do so would be the court of first instance 
that would be another way of spurring the reform process on 
mr president i would like to begin by joining those who congratulated the rapporteur on this work 
the european union is a system based on law 
it must therefore have a system of courts to enforce that law 
furthermore if the courts cannot deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them what happens as madame palacio vallelersundi has already pointed out is that justice delayed becomes as we know justice denied 
the evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem 
in my own country mythology tells of the teeming hordes of faceless brussels bureaucrats but it never mentions the number of european judges 
there are less than three dozen at the apex of the european judicial order hardly an overload given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the european legal system 
this has been compounded so some who advise me believe by the rules of procedure in the french courts which make it well nigh impossible for non-french nationals to proceed against the french government 
certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible 
this contrasts most unfavourably with the united kingdom courts where spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the united kingdom government in circumstances which were very comparable 
what is happening in france mr president appears prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other eu nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the treaties 
i would therefore like to ask the commissioner who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate to look into this and to report back to parliament and to me their findings 
i would be grateful if the commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this 
mr president on behalf of commission president mr prodi i would like to respond as follows 
the commission has taken note of the position adopted today by the european parliament regarding the request made by the court of justice and the court of first instance 
the purport of this request is on the one hand to transfer the assessment of certain appeals to the court of first instance such appeals currently being within the exclusive scope of the court of justice and on the other hand to increase the number of judges at the court of first instance 
may i add that on behalf of the commission i listened with great interest to the pleas which have been made just now and that i have a great deal of sympathy for the unease which underlies these pleas 
the unease is justified 
it has been said more than once justice delayed is justice denied 
the commission sympathises with these considerations 
in the light of this sympathy i would like to continue my response as follows 
as your parliament is aware the commission is convinced that without fundamental reform the community judicial bodies run the risk in the short term of no longer being able to carry out their task within reasonable deadlines 
consequently the commission has asked for the advice of a group of experts regarding the entirety of the reforms which could be implemented in order to enable the court of justice and the court of first instance to maintain the quality and coherence of their administration of justice in forthcoming decades 
the commission is aware of the request made by the court of first instance to increase its number of judges but at the moment the former is of the opinion that the proposed transfer of competence should be seen in the light of the study which i have just mentioned 
in other words once this study is complete the commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible 
thank you commissioner 
the debate is closed 
the vote will take place at a.m. tomorrow 
i have been informed that the rapporteur has been delayed for several minutes 
i propose that we start the debate immediately 
he will join us and speak as soon as he arrives 
i therefore give the floor immediately to mr bourlanges in his capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the committee on budgets 
mr president this is an important and urgent matter and parliament is complying with a request from the commission to come to a decision quickly because today you must realise men and women are dying in kosovo quite simply because the temperature is degrees below zero these people are doing a great deal of work to ensure a minimum of maintenance and they have not been paid 
an urgent request has been referred to us and we approve it 
we have been asked for eur million 
we agree that it may be granted and we call on the commission to be extremely vigilant in ensuring once the decision has been taken that the amounts are set aside and paid as quickly as possible 
we are talking about macrofinancial aid 
there are reactions to this in some quarters since it does not comply with the liberal canons of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration 
this is not our opinion 
our opinion is that it is vital to contribute to setting up an administration in kosovo and that it is by no means absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public employees in this region 
indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in russia throughout the to prevent the disintegration of that state 
the second important problem is that we have been asked for payments the donors have made commitments and obviously we are the only ones actually paying 
the other parties are not paying 
we wish to see an end to this one-sided situation regarding requests for financial aid 
we would like the commission to make commitments on the amendments we are proposing in regard to this 
we would like to link the granting of all aid to the availability of the amounts due from the other donors 
this is not in order to limit or be stingy with our financial contribution to kosovo but quite the contrary to ensure that our contribution is being matched by the contributions of other donors 
from that point of view the proposed facility is a two-phase aid facility and the second tranche must be released as soon as the donors have made clear their interest 
finally we have three questions for the commission in this regard 
firstly we need the commission to give us on a regular basis the list and the amounts that other donors contribute 
when we come to pay we want to know what the others are paying 
secondly we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation 
during the budgetary procedure we were told that the funds for kosovo must be voted on as a matter of urgency yet according to our information no invitation to tender has been published or initiated to date 
this is serious since it holds up the whole process of reconstruction in kosovo 
finally and this follows on from what i have just said we would like the commission to inform the committee on budgets on a very regular basis monthly regarding progress on payments made 
we have commission documents which speak of firm commitments 
it is not firm commitments that we need just plain commitments would suffice and we need to know what has actually been paid and more especially what has not been paid 
kosovo has suffered far too much from delays in payment 
mr president if we are going to discuss kosovo today as we have done many times before then we should also start by taking stock of what has actually already been done in kosovo or of whether in fact anything has been done at all 
what i mean to say is that a few small steps have already been made along the path to normality and it would be nice if they could at least be listed in the course of such a debate 
as of february there will be something known as the kosovo transitional council which will comprise representatives of the political parties the minorities and civil society and which is intended to be a quasi interim parliament 
this is a positive move and we welcome it but i believe we need to equip the individuals concerned with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they are actually going to have to prepare for elections are planned for the autumn 
no one really knows what these elections are to lead to and what kind of parliament is to be formed as a result 
no one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis-à-vis unmik 
in other words there are quite a few imponderables that we are not being informed about and that others are presumably unable to get to grips with properly either 
of all people it is the albanians who are now being integrated into the transitional council who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them 
in addition to financial outlay and reconstruction work urgent attention must also be given to restoring the coexistence of serbs albanians and other minorities not forgetting the roma of course in this country so that at some point in the near future on the road to coexistence it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place 
i would like to list again the things that have actually already been accomplished and that we can be pleased about 
administration-wise there are now tax inspectors 
that is excellent news 
there too people are being encouraged to pay their taxes for it will not do in the long-term for everyone just to depend on handouts from the eu and from other donors some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources 
it should also be noted that of the departments already have administrative leadership which represents an improvement on the situation there hitherto 
there is something else that we are keen to develop and this is very important for a state under the rule of law 
we have judges and public prosecutors who have now been sworn in and who are ready to take up their work of dispensing justice with a view to enriching the culture of tolerance there a little and to at least being able to track criminals down and then secure convictions 
another positive development i would like to remind you of is the fact that the old uck is now bound up in the reconstruction of the country 
i wholly endorse what the committee on budgets had to say on financing and believe that we should remind the commission that it really must press other donors to at long last pay their way 
the eu commission cannot pay for everything 
one could do so once or twice but i feel that the un donors should contribute to this as well for there is a very large hole as yet unfilled that we are unable to fill 
we have a huge task in reconstruction and we will be judged according to how we fulfil it 
mr president i would like to offer a few explanations 
in a debate there is always the danger that we will repeat much of what has already been said 
however i would like to concentrate on two points 
firstly i would like to make it very clear that the union is the main contributor to aid for the reconstruction of kosovo 
i would like to point out to mrs albright that what we have read recently in the press is true and that figures do not lie 
let us make this clear however much some people may not wish to believe it 
the union has decided to assist with a further eur million in additional macrofinancial aid for the reconstruction of kosovo on the basis of an imf report which estimates that a further eur million is needed for that reconstruction 
i would like to say to mrs pack that i am in complete agreement with her when she says that the commission should insist that other contributors fulfil their commitments 
i would also like to express my concern which is very considerable at the statement by some ministers at the last ecofin that says that it should be a priority of the portuguese presidency not to alter in any circumstances the financial perspectives agreed in berlin 
this calls into question the agreement which parliament reached with great difficulty with the council in december according to which when the commission presents a multiannual programme for reconstruction the financial perspectives would be reviewed where necessary 
i would like to appeal to those ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach 
i would like to ask the commission and i am glad that commissioner solbes is here with us this evening to present us in time with this multiannual finance programme with the corresponding report requested by parliament so that it may be taken into account when the preliminary draft of the next budget is drawn up as we have been promised 
lastly i would like to insist that although we have agreed to eur million now we know that this is a stopgap solution and that it is not enough and we should therefore reach an agreement as soon as possible on the multiannual reconstruction programme for kosovo which is so badly needed 
mr president ladies and gentlemen please excuse my late arrival but this other political issue is still on the agenda today more is the pity 
the committee on foreign affairs human rights common security and defence policy would advise you to release the eur million and this piece of advice is given because this money can truly benefit those in need 
the things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there 
however this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process 
of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the council administration had not forgotten to inform the european parliament in good time and to provide it with official documents 
only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions 
i urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future 
it is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this 
however we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here 
one condition is that money should be given to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursuing other aims 
secondly even if the commission and the council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into 
this mission is being conducted under the auspices of the united nations and we cannot have a situation where the european union is the only one to fulfil its obligations 
it is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe in the interests of the persons affected 
this brings me onto the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general terms that is to say not just with this specific project but with overall developments in south-east europe and with the aid delivered there 
this is another example of the fact that the european union is prepared to help and to give money but the political leadership lacks coherence 
we have so many coordinators who in turn are responsible to so many employers that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinators 
perhaps it would be better however if the positions of responsibility within the european union and the other institutions from the osce to the united nations were to get together some time to introduce a uniform coordinated procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there 
i know that the commission is thinking seriously about how to achieve this but if the european union is doing the most work out there then it should also be given the leadership and bring coherence to the situation so that we can be of real assistance to the people 
it makes no sense at all for the various international institutions and associations to be engaged in competition amongst themselves rather than investing all their energies in helping the people on the ground 
bearing in mind that the conference of donors for the stability pact is constantly being postponed it is now set for the end of march that no one knows which projects are actually in the pipeline that one cannot tell how things can actually be implemented and there is a steady stream of new press conferences this does not appear to be the way to restore peace and reconciliation amongst peoples to this region of europe 
accordingly we would like to take this opportunity to urge the commission and council presidency to seize this political initiative so as to avoid us landing in such a desperate situation again and having to restore our solvency at the end of a month 
rather we must use this initiative to establish a long-term aid strategy for this country and i hope that in the process you will fulfil your political obligations at long last and not allow things to continue as they have been doing for the past few months 
mr president when the alliance intervened in kosovo its objective was to re-establish conditions in this province which would enable those who wished to do so to stay there or return with respect for their own heritage and their own culture 
if the alliance is still active in that region it is with the same objective 
the day before yesterday i was pleased to hear an interview given by the kfor commander showing how much better matters in connection with this in kosovo were starting to be particularly as regards security crime levels had been restored to an acceptable level 
those representing europe who are active at the grass roots level in pursuing this objective and i am thinking in particular of the special representative of the secretary-general of the united nations are on the verge of despondency precisely because since matters are improving there is less talk of kosovo and the urgent nature of the aid which is needed there is becoming less apparent 
we must work to ensure that in this province and indeed throughout the balkans generally the rule of shopkeepers follows the rule of the warlords 
it is true that economic aid is in this respect certainly an essential element to the scope of action afforded those people active at the grass roots level 
let me reiterate the comment which doris pack has just made and stress that we the members of the european parliament must fulfil our own obligations in this regard while ensuring of course that we are not the only ones to do so 
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen firstly i would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur mr brok for his report 
if the council had worked as quickly as mr brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on 
the rapporteur and the report are right to start from the premise that we should and must provide help swiftly however it is also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random 
i would particularly like to draw your attention to amendment no at this point which clearly emphasises that it is only possible and permissible to use the funds from the special financial aid to finance those kosovan budgetary requirements arising from public or semi-public communal and other authorities and institutions which are controlled either directly or indirectly by unmik 
commissioner it must be made clear that we support unmik and the institutions set up by the united nations in particular pillar of course and it will not do for us to support the parallel structures that have formed in kosovo and are still in place 
what is to be done with this money 
i would like to highlight the issue of human rights 
the west fought for human rights in kosovo and what is happening there today 
we were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the serbs but almost every day insupportable things happen people are killed people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit 
every single day there are attacks on serbs on the roma on bosnians but attacks are also still carried out on albanians 
i was in fact shocked to read in the report assuming this is true how an albanian doctor who was working in the hospital in the serbian quarter of mitrovica under what must have been great difficulties ultimately had to give up helping his kinsmen in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life 
these are events and situations that cannot be tolerated 
i hear whether it is true or not i do not know that the serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the serbian sector of kosovo 
there are at the very least rumours that serbian militias are up to their old tricks again 
it is irrelevant as far as i am concerned as to whether it is serbs roma bosnians or albanians who are threatened or killed in kosovo 
it is also irrelevant in my view as to who is working towards separation and division in kosovo 
what is all-important to my mind is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve a multi-ethnic kosovo that is a kosovo where people can live together 
we need more police officers as we have nowhere near enough 
we need an independent judiciary this would certainly be difficult to establish we also need funds for the office of high commissioner for human rights 
all of this needs to happen and quickly too 
if we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise 
that is why i believe that we were right to take action quickly to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available 
only now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in kosovo and i would urge the commission to see that these funds are put to good use notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary 
 
this will no doubt allow us to release the funds for kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both mr swoboda and mrs pack have mentioned 
firstly although much progress has been made and we could mention customs administration bank administration or tax administration it is true that we must continue to move forward 
however in moving forward what should we be financing 
this is the first point on which there is a certain amount of disagreement 
in some of your amendments you propose that we limit further the type of bodies which can be provided with union funds for example amendments nos and 
in our view however in both respects greater room for manoeuvre should be left to the administration of the united nations which on the ground is more aware of the reality than we are 
we believe that to prejudge at the moment where resources should be directed would create more practical difficulties 
in short we should put our faith in those parties who in these areas are better equipped than us to make certain decisions 
the second concern which i notice that many of you share it was first expressed by mr bourlanges but others have repeated it refers to the situation regarding the other donors 
is the commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate 
some of the amendments in your report pose this question 
for example amendments nos and 
i would say to mr bourlanges and to those who have raised this issue that this is not the fundamental problem although we recognise it totally 
the fundamental problem is that at the moment the distribution of the burden amongst the different donors has been established in the statements of the high level steering group but it is also true that they have no legal status 
this is simply a political commitment 
that is the reason why while accepting its spirit we would ask that amendment no be worded differently and we have sent a note to mr brok in this respect so that it does not imply conditionality in the provision of community resources 
i would say the same about amendment no which we would also accept with a slight modification since the idea seems to us to be basically correct 
amendment no is of a similar nature 
on this specific point we can perhaps offer mr bourlanges greater satisfaction 
we have already spoken to the council so that it might include a commission statement in its decision establishing this element of conditionality 
with regard to the second contribution what we propose is that the exact amount and the date for the implementation of the second stage should be decided in accordance with the external financial needs of kosovo and the contributions of other bilateral donors 
in other words we should not establish conditionality or we believe that it is more effective not to establish conditionality from the start but nevertheless we should establish it with regard to the possible liberalisation of the second stage 
in this way we would have no problem in acting immediately 
we would not create problems for the kosovar people but on the other hand we would force the other donors to make their financial contribution in the way that we are doing 
a third problem has been raised by mrs dührkop with regard to the multiannual programmes 
i would remind you that these projects are multiannual 
the programmes clearly have to take the annual budgetary contributions into account 
lastly i would like to make some observations on the requests for additional information which have been addressed to us 
the commission can commit itself to regularly informing parliament of the invitations to tender which are published 
we also wish to see these publicised on the internet so that there may be maximum transparency with regard to this specific point 
a second point which i would like to comment on is the remaining information which may be of importance to parliament with regard to the provision of macroeconomic assistance 
in this respect i would like to tell you that the commission is prepared to keep the chairmen of the various committees involved in this area regularly informed on a confidential basis if the nature of the information provided requires confidentiality on the different schemes being implemented for macroeconomic assistance 
thank you very much ladies and gentlemen and i hope that with the final decision of the council we can release these funds and make a positive contribution to maintaining the considerable effort being made in kosovo by different parties so that we might achieve that situation of greater coexistence and peace which we all wish to see 
mr president i am pleased to see the convergence of viewpoints there is between parliament particularly the committee on budgets and the commission and we can assure you that for our part we shall always be there to assist the commission in the performance of its duties 
i do however have one small concern when i hear the commissioner on the subject of the commitments made by their services in the committee on budgets 
there was a clear agreement good or bad i will not say but there was a contract 
there was a clear understanding between the commission services and the committee on budgets that there was agreement on amendments and i.e on the idea of linking the mobilisation the implementation of the second tranche of macrofinancial aid to the condition that donors should first have fulfilled their relative obligations in terms of payment 
but if i understand what mr solbes mira says correctly then this undertaking was only a tentative one 
commissioner an agreement is an agreement 
can you confirm the agreement made by your services in the committee on budgets yes or no 
or are you going to drop this proviso thus breaking the undertaking made to us 
no mr bourlanges i think it is a substantive problem 
the problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted 
with this we believe that we are totally in line with what we agreed 
i am simply asking the commission to come and inform the committee on budgets before implementing the second tranche 
i agree absolutely 
we shall do so 
the debate is closed 
the vote will take place at a.m. tomorrow 
mr president i would like to thank mr langen although he is not actually here for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in parliament and in the council 
the project has been long and problematic 
in future too there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources 
although there is much that is good about the new directive it is nonetheless not without its defects 
one example is the use of peat 
peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels 
if peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable non-fossil energy source it must form its own class especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned 
it is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as for example coal 
dependence on imported energy affects worst of all many eastern european countries whose economic structure is still suffering from the dependence created in the times of the soviet union on russian energy 
the eu must adhere to the kyoto protocol on climate 
the share that renewable energy sources have in total energy production must be increased but it has to be done in a rational manner 
we have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on renewables for a long time to come 
for that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate nuclear energy 
mr president forgive me for arriving a little late but in fact the programme moved on a little faster than anticipated 
i would like to thank mrs matikainen-kallström for standing in 
she has already said something about the altener and save programmes 
we now find ourselves in the final stages of a conciliation process on measures in the energy sector for the period with altener relating to the important sector of renewable energies 
this is intended to create the necessary preconditions for implementing an action plan in this sector and in particular for offering additional incentives to invest private or public money in the production and usage of renewable energies 
since the current programme finished at the end of last year and the council did not accept the amendments adopted by parliament the conciliation procedure had to come into play 
it is quite amazing as to how doggedly the member states in the council tried to fight this programme for alternative energies and an appropriate level of funding 
however i have to say the finnish president-in-office of the council had relatively little power to act as long as the member states blocked the necessary increase in this funding 
the original financial package of eur million as proposed by the commission was reduced by the council to eur million unilaterally and without explanation 
it was therefore only logical that parliament should demand the reinstatement of the original financial package 
in addition to the funding for the programme there were a few other points that the council and parliament were in dispute over 
it was possible in the course of the conciliation procedure to reach agreement with the council on those of our essential demands one being to examine the possibility of opening the altener programme to the associated mediterranean countries when this programme next undergoes revision 
we were assured that the council will publish a statement on this in the official journal 
as far as the financial framework is concerned had the council significantly reduced its original package it would have come close to jeopardising the continued existence of the programme 
the parliamentary delegation in the conciliation committee was concerned to secure the continued existence of the contents of a worthwhile programme 
hence we agreed to the compromise in the end even though we were not completely satisfied with it 
we accepted that the funding should be raised to eur million 
that is an acceptable albeit not entirely satisfactory outcome 
we opted for this compromise so as not to jeopardise the continued existence of this programme 
however it would appear that unless there are increased efforts on the part of the member states it will not be possible to achieve the goal of producing % of the overall primary energy demand from renewable energy sources by the year 
accordingly we have secured the continuation of an eu programme that is important in terms of environmental and economic policy and that is instrumental in limiting co2 emissions increasing the proportion of renewable energies in the overall energy balance reducing dependence on energy imports providing security of supply and ensuring cohesion of local and regional development 
of course the programme alone is not enough it must be complemented by strenuous efforts on the part of the member states 
on december last year the conciliation committee adopted the definitive text for the programme thereby paving the way for the future promotion of studies and projects within the alternative energies sector aimed at tapping into the potential of renewable energies 
in addition the continued existence of the altener programme will guarantee the promotion and implementation of pilot projects for creating and extending infrastructure for transfer of expertise and for targeted activities intended to relieve market penetration of renewable energies 
this will be of particular relevance to the wind energy and geothermal sectors to smaller-scale hydroelectric powerstations to the passive and active use of solar energy in buildings and to the use of biomass 
these sectors show us how necessary and important it is to continue to provide a rational support framework at european level in the alternative energy sources sector 
mr president on behalf of the pse group i welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the altener ii programme 
firstly however i would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur mr langen for the truly excellent work he has done on this report 
i would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the conciliation committee mr provan 
for as mr langen said just now we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the conciliation committee 
however we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the european parliament throughout 
this is not satisfactory i would like to make that quite clear 
however we agreed to this compromise because it was important to us to enable this programme to be launched very soon indeed 
for in the course of the next few years the proportion of renewable energy sources is to double accounting for at least % of energy consumption 
that being the case since altener is the only eu programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources it will certainly be have a key role 
in the first place this new five-year programme will entail extending the actions in the altener i programme 
this will include extending the exchange of information and expertise between operators in the renewable energy sources sector developing local and regional energy agencies and establishing new networks for approving financial support to name but a few examples 
to my mind though what is particularly important about the altener ii programme are the new actions for relieving market saturation by renewable energies and those for implementing supporting and monitoring the community strategy and the community action plan 
it contains plans for financial support for all the main renewable energy sources sectors 
it is very important for this altener programme to go hand in hand with this campaign and to support it 
the overall investment costs for this campaign are estimated to be approximately eur billion 
% % of this is to come from private sources and this will be supplemented by public funds from the member states and from the regions 
in this respect the altener programme will be able to create new incentives and smooth the way for investment and help us to realise our ambition in the interests of environmental protection the economy and creating new jobs 
mr president commissioner i would like to thank mr langen for his excellent work in this important matter 
the conclusion reached regarding conciliation with regard to the altener programme as put forward by the conciliation committee is after all the difficult phases it has been through at least satisfactory 
the union has ambitious goals with regard to increasing the use of renewable energy 
there is very little in the way of appropriations to meet these targets however 
the appropriations are needed for pilot projects research information exchange and also to cultivate more positive attitudes towards the use of renewable energy 
the main responsibility for increasing the use of renewables is to be borne by the member states 
this programme will hopefully encourage member states to act with greater determination to increase the use of renewable energy 
however in the future the union will also have to increase its own input in promoting the use of renewable energy and ensuring that renewable energy is launched without obstacles on the market 
promoting the use of renewables is especially important for the environment 
the union cannot achieve its environmental goals unless the use of renewables is actively stepped up 
renewable energy sources lower dependency on imported energy and their increased use boosts competitiveness 
europe will also be able to achieve a leading position in the industry that supplies equipment needed for the exploitation of renewable energy 
we should also remember that the use of renewable energy sources has a positive impact on regional development and employment 
may i also venture to raise the matter of peat 
peat is not mentioned in the list of renewable energy sources 
however it is important at least in finland as a sustainably used slowly renewable energy source 
i hope that in the future it can be included in the list of renewables 
it is interesting for me as a new member of parliament to see that the budget provides for hundreds of millions of euros annually for tobacco cultivation 
this is a limited sector of the economy which creates hardly any jobs and is not competitive on the world scale 
in contrast with that i see the amounts allocated for renewable energies which are not only an ecological element but which look set to undergo considerable economic expansion 
seeing the market share that small countries such as denmark have been capable of acquiring in this field because they were the first ones to develop that area gives one food for thought i feel and i think that in the long term it will ultimately be necessary to actually increase the budgets for renewable energies 
one last word regarding the programme 
i think it very important for renewable energies to be firmly established in the regions so that they can develop in the long term and so that they can contribute to the economy and to job creation there 
in order to ensure that at least % of the energy mix comes from renewable energy sources it is not enough to deal with a few hot spots that will be more profitable in the short term 
mr president may i commence by complimenting mr langen on his work 
the activities of the altener programme will promote renewable energy sources and i believe that such programmes merit financial support at the developmental stage as they offer enormous commercial potential in the future 
for this reason i am particularly pleased to see the monies focussed on projects by small and medium-sized enterprises 
the internationally agreed objectives for reducing emissions cannot be achieved by these programmes alone 
in this regard it must be remembered that energy policy remains within the national remit 
it is imperative that national governments lend their full support to improving energy efficiency and developing renewables 
i am pleased that ireland has recently announced that it is going to spend million on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector 
i would hope that the contribution of altener would lead to more initiatives 
as the final text rightly states actions such as these can play a role in reducing regional disparities 
i support all efforts to close the gap in economic development in infrastructural provisions including the energy sector 
in short we face a major challenge in meeting our commitments on limiting greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector under the kyoto protocol while at the same time promoting growth in our economies 
altener will make a valuable contribution to the combined efforts of the member states 
mr president mr langen ladies and gentlemen as our rapporteur mentioned we are coming to the end of a long and difficult process of conciliation with the council on the altener programme 
mr langen mentioned that the implementation budget proposed by the council was initially ff million whereas the commission proposed million a figure which the european parliament supported 
an initial conciliation meeting was not successful because the council would not at that time accept an increase of eur million 
we could not agree with a proposal like this which challenged the authority of the european parliament 
a second round of conciliation achieved an increase of eur million in order to reach this compromise figure of million 
in spite of an increase of million in relation to the initial proposal personally once again i deplore the fact that the funds allocated do not match up to the ambitions expressed and that the concern to save money displayed by the council in this situation is in rude contrast to its declarations in favour of the safety of the energy supply job creation and environmental protection challenges that are just as significant which we must face up to 
in fact renewable energies unquestionably provide a way of achieving these objectives 
it is practically certain that with the raft of proposed measures and actions it should be possible to approach the objective of a % renewable energy share by doubling the current rate as long as the appropriations including state appropriations are made available 
this programme together with the save ii programme integrating the environmental aspect into energy policy establishes a foundation for a real community strategy to achieve clean energy while reducing our dependence 
and in conclusion mr president let me also insist upon the fact that in addition to the measures proposed there are also legislative measures and most especially adequate budget allocations to back up these political initiatives 
and i shall end of course by congratulating mr langen our rapporteur on his work as well as all the members of the committee and of the conciliation committee 
 
all of this will provide greater coordination transparency and efficiency in our energy programmes into which we will also have to incorporate the save programme which we will be discussing soon 
i would like to say that the work carried out during this time by parliament has been of a high quality and i therefore congratulate the rapporteur mr langen and also all the various speakers who have spoken both in committee and here in plenary 
obviously there have been arguments we had to go to conciliation as the rapporteur and mr caudron reminded us a moment ago since at the first meeting no result was achieved and there had to be a second meeting despite the fact that the figures were not excessive 
however i believe that in the end we have reached a reasonable agreement which like all agreements is perhaps not perfect but which i believe allows us to push ahead with the projects with which we were dealing 
i would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur mr langen on his work to thank the speakers and of course to acknowledge the actions of vice-president provan throughout the conciliation procedure who contributed efficiently to the achievement of a positive result 
i would also like to recognise the reasonable and flexible action of the council 
madam president i would like to thank the council and commission for a useful and thorough conciliation procedure and one that was good-tempered all round which is not always the case 
i am happy to say that i can regard the end result of conciliation as very satisfactory for parliament as the joint text has incorporated all its amendments either in full or in a re-worded form 
i therefore propose that this house agree to adopt the proposals on save and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading 
the commission accepted five of the proposed amendments including the budgetary allocation and i thank the commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure as what the council had proposed was unacceptable 
during the procedure agreement was reached on the studies and actions to devise implement complement and assess the community measures 
compromise wordings were agreed for five other amendments including legislative and non-legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centres and very importantly the energy audit systems in the review of progress on energy efficiency 
i hope that you will all agree that this is important progress 
in the event we had to have several meetings before the council finally increased this to a substantial amount 
we got an increase of million on their starting figure which was a decisive increase which i can recommend to you and which the commission confirmed that it could implement the programmes under 
this was an important consideration for us 
i would like to say however that it is and has always been a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real 
funding for energy saving still comes primarily from the member states 
we have to bear that in mind when approving this programme 
if there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at community level this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action including community actions on energy saving 
where the community can step in is to put the local activators in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-invent the wheel in every region 
we have an important part to play in the community in the european union in this regard 
save is the only community-wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy 
it focuses on non-technical elements helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted 
here we need to realise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy savings 
we have heard a lot about difficulties of competition in renewable energies but energy efficiency saves money for business saves money all round in fact and therefore it should be non-problematical 
it is something that we can all support 
i have to say like motherhood although we all support it sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the mothers or the people engaged in energy-saving 
we could do rather more considering that we have made great commitments in reducing co2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports 
we are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see 
we are not making the connection so that the citizens can actually do something concretely either at home or in their offices or in industry to support action against global climate change 
if we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do 
i would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process 
madam president ladies and gentlemen i would once again like to thank mrs ahern for her work as rapporteur on this proposal since she has contributed in collaboration with the other members to the achievement of a very reasonable final result which in some respects even improves on the proposals of the commission itself and of course on what from a budgetary point of view the council had initially accepted 
as mrs ahern has explained very well the budgets of both the save programme and the altener programme are basically symbolic budgets since the burden is shouldered by the countries the states of the union the regions or even in some cases the local authorities 
however despite the fact that the volume is relatively small it is nevertheless symbolically important that there is a common desire throughout the community as a whole to support this type of action which contributes to our genuine compliance with the kyoto commitments 
this action also contributes to achieving greater diversification in terms of our energy sources greater safety in our energy supplies and in the case of save to reducing consumption and increasing efficiency in the use of energy thereby contributing to achieving the objectives set 
furthermore behind these programmes that is to say the save programme which concerns greater efficiency and energy savings and the altener programme which concerns renewable energy there lies an extremely important technological challenge which from an economic point of view may offer significant opportunities to industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and therefore in the union as a whole 
i would also like to express my gratitude because an improvement on the initial offer of funds has been achieved 
from the point of view of the commission in this interinstitutional game i believe that this is important and i am very happy to highlight it 
i would like once again to thank all the speakers and also especially the vice-president mr provan for his magnificent work throughout this debate particularly during the conciliation procedure as well as the chairman of the committee on industry and also above all the rapporteur mrs ahern and all the members who have participated in this work 
thank you commissioner 
the debate is closed 
the vote will take place at a.m. tomorrow 
madam president in spite of article of the treaty of amsterdam culture has been the poor relative in terms of the reduced range of programmes and financial technical and human resources found for the european project 
some may say that the prevailing objectives fifty years ago when the european home in which we now live was founded were more specifically economic and social ones 
it may also be said that european policies have suffered throughout these five decades from the innumerable and crazy whims that have held sway in a wide variety of situations and for a wide variety of reasons 
this model for civilisation is rooted in deep cultural diversity 
a europe of national identities can live for a long time in peace and prosperity if this cultural diversity maintains its vitality and eliminates the small-mindedness and aggressiveness caused by resentments which as a rule give rise to excessively nationalistic feelings 
therefore for this understanding and sharing to be fully possible they must be based on a concept of culture which involves the crucial dimension of european democracy 
there is no doubt that genuine convergence economic and social cohesion the single currency the fight against unemployment and social exclusion and even competition are all necessary to create conditions which can provide greater equality greater development a better quality of life and better opportunities for the people of europe 
there is no doubt that we aim to gain acceptance for our policy on defending human rights throughout the world 
if however cultural policies cannot give a superior and clearly distinctive meaning to all of this neither europe nor european democracy will be able to make much progress 
it is through culture alone that millions upon millions of our citizens are able to recognise themselves as europeans and can cultivate develop and broaden this feeling of being part of europe 
this madam president is the kind of impetus that european politics needs 
we talk about culture cultural cooperation symbolic action major initiatives and networks of cultural agents and operators but any mention of the european institutions having a cultural policy is carefully avoided 
this by the way would not impinge on the principle of subsidiarity in the slightest 
we even speak rhetorically sometimes in quite reasonable terms about the importance of culture for the european project and yet ridiculous appropriations are allocated to programmes supposed to serve over million people on a permanent ongoing basis 
these programmes are designed to give them access to a heritage that belongs to them and which should stimulate an active and interactive appetite for contact with the highest values and with the great works in which they are represented 
let us remember that culture establishes a unique financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation 
the conciliation procedure yielded satisfactory solutions to almost all the amendments adopted at second reading 
it was still set on a solution which would mitigate this position 
thanks to her the commission committed itself to presenting a report before june on the operation of the programme in which it will state whether the available financial resources are adequate or not 
it may possibly also offer a review of this item 
i cannot hide the fact that the success of this proposal will depend in the final analysis on an institutional mechanism being found which corresponds to the basic meaning of the word conciliation 
nevertheless i shall conclude my speech by proposing to this house that it should vote in favour of the joint text adopted by the conciliation committee for the culture programme and i wish it every success 
madam president i actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate 
unfortunately there has been no change in the way that the council always talks about culture but fails to allocate any money for it 
we have the feeling and are in fact convinced that the member states would be more than happy to withdraw the things they wrote in in the treaty of maastricht 
for no one is very keen to spend money on culture 
sadly that is the case and we must face facts 
i would like to thank the rapporteur who really has chipped away tirelessly at this monumental task in conjunction with the commissioner of course 
we simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect 
one seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision 
what kind of horse-trading system is this 
certainly not a fair one 
there are always people who are in a position to reject everything and there we are on the other side begging for a little more money for culture 
it is downright scandalous what goes on 
it is an awful sort of horse-trading based on unequal positions 
nevertheless we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to 
it lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us 
we will support small and medium-sized events not the large ones and we will afford individual citizens and also the smaller operators easier access 
if one puts all the money together and creates synergy then one can be a tiny bit satisfied but then only a tiny bit 
it is my hope that we will be able to achieve a lot of synergy with a little money 
madam president i agree with the fine words with which the rapporteur began his intervention and i must add that during the conciliation procedure i was personally a little disappointed with the council 
on the one hand it continued to refuse to accept the term european cultural policy or other similar terms even undervaluing the terms of the treaty and it defines culture simply as an instrument for cultural cooperation and no more 
on the other hand it has shown complete intransigence with regard to the funds requested by this parliament which were minimal anyway 
incidentally this last point would be unfair to fourteen members of the council since it was just one the netherlands which was responsible for that intransigence 
it has once again been demonstrated that conciliation is incompatible with the demand for unanimity in the council 
this demand makes conciliation almost impossible and even affects the dignity of the parliamentary institution 
by taking action in the field of culture we are directly contributing to the construction of a european soul especially given the fact that the sub-programmes which make up culture are superb 
in recent years these have been amongst the programmes most eagerly accepted by the youngest and most dynamic citizens of the european union 
lastly i would like to mention the profoundly human impression i have formed of the rapporteur mr graça moura his knowledge his sense of balance his intellectual qualities make him in my opinion the best possible rapporteur this report could have had 
congratulations 
finally i would like to congratulate commissioner reding vice-president imbeni and mr gargani chairman of the committee on culture for the firm and intelligent position which each within his own role they have maintained during the entire conciliation process 
madam president commissioner rapporteur i would like to start by thanking mr graça moura most warmly for the tremendous efforts he has put into the discussion of this culture programme 
it has been said before and we have discussed this between ourselves on various occasions that culture is of course extremely important as an area unto itself i would like to stress this once again but also as the instrument par excellence for furthering the european idea 
it is also of great importance to citizens 
we should above all not lose sight of this 
the impetus given to the european idea by this programme is having an enormous impact especially on small linguistic areas such as the netherlands which not only has national potential but is also relying on support from the programme mainly from a language point of view 
today we have arrived at the end of a long road 
i would nonetheless like as others have done to touch upon the procedure which is unclear and above all unwanted 
codecision and unanimity do not go hand in hand 
they are like a snake biting its own tail 
there is little room for negotiation if one of the parties states beforehand anything is open for discussion as long as the budget stays fixed 
as it happens and i would like to add this for the sake of the netherlands negotiations on this matter have taken place at an earlier stage 
the result is % growth so we are not completely dissatisfied with the result 
of course it is always better to make more funding available more quickly and i for one will always advocate this but i do think that this programme opens up good opportunities for quite a few programmes 
i would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular pot 
culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas 
a great deal of money for culture is also set aside in the structural funds and this is something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind 
fortunately i am on the committee on regional policy 
so i myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention 
i think that we have also opted in favour of allowing the budget to be of an adequate size because if it happens to be cancelled then surely this does not benefit the citizen 
i have always given the rapporteur my backing in this respect 
however i do think that it is necessary as he always states too that in the next igc changes will be made to codecision when unanimity will no longer be necessary 
we are very positive about the many improvements which have been made no more mega-projects room for cultural networks and sufficient attention to promoting reading translating and translation companies 
this is especially important to smaller linguistic areas 
i would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also mrs reding for culture 
all that remains for me to say is time to get down to business 
madam president all that i wanted to say has been covered by those fellow members who spoke before me and i think there is unanimity among the groups in the european parliament and among those of us on the committee on culture 
i too must say that i will be voting for this joint text for a council and european parliament decision with a very heavy heart 
it is shameful 
that figure of eur million for so many years is a disgrace for the european union 
when we are compelled literally to humiliate theatre groups young musicians pioneering activities in the arts writers to humiliate them and send them packing with a slap on the back and thirty rejection slips in such a way that they begin to perceive europe as something foreign something opposed contrary and hostile to any effort towards cultural creativity an area in which the european union should make its presence felt because our mission is not just the euro not just enlargement nor geostrategic expedients but also to encourage culture to flower in this affair of european unification then this is indeed a sorry way to end 
so long as we continue to have unanimity so long as yesterday the dutch government was able to impose those eur million as an ultimatum and so long as a government with mr haider will soon be telling us what cultural activities we can pursue we will never progress 
of course we felt the need to simplify and consolidate the previous programmes but everyone hoped that the culture programme could help to promote for example the unique features of each cultural sector even and i could say especially of the unique features of less well-known sectors 
we hope that this at the least will come about during the evaluation process 
we sincerely believe in the validity of cultural action among other things in terms of making a contribution to the social as well as economic development of a people 
and a fully-fledged europe can compete with the rest of the world and fully rediscover its roots highlight its common cultural heritage and enhance and restore dignity to cultural and linguistic islands that until now were less well-known 
the overall growth of the european union and the awareness of being european citizens this is why we believe that the culture programme albeit with a scarcity of funds can make a considerable contribution to this great common goal 
madam president i will add to the unanimity of the evening and say that i support the adoption of culture and add my thanks to the rapporteur mr graça moura who took over from our former colleague nana mouskouri 
both of them have done a first-class job 
alongside the debate we had earlier on in the day culture may not seem that important but it is and we have to be careful in the european parliament not to allow the urgent to get in the way of the important 
why do i say that culture is important 
but more importantly than that cultural activities are what make mankind civilised 
culture is at the root of our democratic beliefs and an uncultured society is not going to sustain tolerance and freedom and democracy 
cultural diversity is important and it is under threat 
however it is not under threat from europe 
we do drink port wine and we do like german beer and we even use finnish saunas but it is not from europe that culture is under threat 
what i do see right across europe is people drinking coca cola eating hamburgers wearing baseball caps watching hollywood films and often doing all this at the same time 
that is what culture is about 
so i say to the council of ministers keep this programme genuinely under review 
are we doing enough 
and i say to madame reding thank you for the support and the help you have given so far keep up the good work we are on your side 
madam president i too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur graa moura and commissioner reding for their contribution to the creation of this programme 
the culture programme was finalised at the end of last year as a result of conciliation between parliament and the council 
the outcome can be considered reasonable when we take into account the fact that the adoption of the programme called for a unanimous decision to be made in the council 
we have to hope that at the forthcoming igc we will also end up with qualified majority decisions in the area of culture 
it is really strange that legislation that adheres to the codecision procedure when it is being debated requires unanimity for it to be passed in the council 
the framework programme on culture is replacing the present kaleidoscope ariane and raphael programmes 
when implementation of the programme begins i hope in particular that the scope it offers for literature and the translation of books can be utilised to the full 
i believe and hope that despite the assault on us all of the new technology literature will maintain its status 
we need the depth of spirit that literature provides in the midst of a culture that has a short attention span and is inclined towards the superficial 
literature likewise plays an important part in the way it transmits our cultural heritage increases mutual familiarity and preserves linguistic wealth and the diversity of tongues 
in this connection i am very glad to say that soon after the socrates and culture programmes get under way officially at the meeting of the council of ministers in march in lisbon the country holding the presidency of the eu is to organise a conference to discuss the situation of public libraries 
i hope that this conference will also encourage the commission to take the issue of libraries into active consideration in the fifth framework programme in respect of the information society 
we have had a great deal to say today about europe as a community of values about tolerance human dignity human rights a positive approach to the enlargement process transparency and respect for each other 
youth education and cultural policies are important tools for creating these values for giving the citizens confidence in the european union and making it credible in their eyes 
cultural activity creates identity 
we want a colourful europe 
we want a europe based on the principle of diversity within unity 
we want people to understand and learn to appreciate differences 
that is why we spoke in favour of breaking down the budget the allocation of funds that is into the different types of measure 
that is why we opposed concentrating heavily on large networks and network structures because we want to promote the small and medium-sized entities and activities performed by individuals because we want to see thousands of flowers bloom 
i would like to second what the previous speaker had to say 
there is a contradiction in terms unanimity principle codecision procedure and conciliation committee and it is one we must resolve if we want to strengthen and not further weaken the principles of cultural policy that are to create a european consciousness 
madam president as we have heard all the groups have a common political enemy in the council 
in this way the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a blockading instrument of the first order 
the battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years and now at long last the european parliament can give the go-ahead 
the council could not be moved not even when the precursor programmes kaleidoscope ariane and raphael finished 
a pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap 
the political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support 
out of applications in only projects with a low overall volume of eur million could be considered 
the council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to accommodate parliament to the tune of even a single euro 
and so the moderate sum of million will stand until 
there is a blatant discrepancy here 
and so we are going to have to be content albeit very grudgingly with the fact that we have at least managed to achieve something in terms of content 
previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out 
we can only hope that it will after all be possible to persuade the council to have a change of heart one day 
perhaps the council will come to understand that cultural activities do the european union good not harm 
cultural cooperation and this was also mentioned earlier truly creates identity far more so than any transport directive however important it might be 
providing support for culture meets with wide-spread acceptance and this certainly cannot be said of all policy decisions 
what may i ask is the council afraid of 
madam president whoever has the honour like myself to chair the committee on culture cannot fail to agree with the comments from various members and can but congratulate the rapporteur and commissioner reding with whom he worked and who even during the conciliation process had difficult moments and opposed the council you have heard this said by everyone 
i have noticed how the principle of a necessary culture at european organisational level has been firmly asserted but there are few opportunities to address all the requests that the european states will make 
i shall simply stress my own personal complaint because in the end we did not manage to adopt a review clause 
however mrs reding was certainly receptive and farsighted and personally undertook to review the issue and carry out a comprehensive assessment within a few years and therefore to change the situation 
the cultural programmes launched in years past kaleidoscope ariane and raphael are being replaced by a single programme culture where and i must stress this here very forcefully the rapporteur censures a position which should give the european parliament cause for reflection as someone said this afternoon but which still underlines the huge importance of being part of a vast community where cultural interpretation is a democratic factor 
this is not rhetoric but the new embodiment of a modern liberalism which unites the european states and constitutes a turning point for the european parliament and the commission 
man and culture are priorities and culture can result in economic growth 
let us contemplate this result derive satisfaction from it and grant ourselves a licence to fully embrace this worthwhile strategy 
madam president may i first thank mr graça moura for weaving his way through the rather tough textiles and fibres that have made up this conciliation tapestry 
it seems to me when entering the conciliation process for culture having a poet to lead us in our endeavours is entirely appropriate 
again because these conciliations are not entirely straight forward we have to thank vice-president imbeni for his exemplary negotiating skills in the convoluted field of ensuring that cultural expenditure is wisely deployed and given to us in our community 
the fundamental question it seems to me that faces this parliament the commission and the council is what is europe 
what does it mean and what does europe give us over and above the parameters of our national boundaries 
that is what culture represents 
it represents the possibility of sustaining a european identity in the twenty-first century an identity which eschews the echoes of division of war of poverty of opportunity of poverty dans la realité 
and more than this and this is more prosaic madam president it means that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiatives by putting them into action in new programmes that are comprehensive that are cross-cutting and that benefit our creative industries to the extent that they now require 
it promotes mobility and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded 
my only regret is that in promoting this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspirations and ensure our ability to deliver 
madam president ladies and gentlemen we have now come to the end of a long road 
we shall thus in the course of the next five years have a tool perfectly suited to developing clear well-structured and i am sure successful measures in order to promote the cultural sector 
i wish to thank everyone in this parliament who worked to achieve this successful outcome to the conciliation process 
i should like to express especial thanks to the committee on culture youth education the media and sport particularly to its rapporteur mr graça moura its chairman mr gargani the european parliament delegation and the leaders of the political groups the conciliation committee and its chairman mr imbeni 
they all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution 
throughout the negotiations they were of great help and it must be said that the difficult and occasionally tiresome negotiations were nonetheless completed in record time 
we now have a framework programme the first of its type for the cultural sector and this programme makes it possible for us to plan our action from a new perspective and to work to promote culture in a more comprehensive but also more thorough and detailed manner 
i would like to express my delight with you at this pleasing outcome 
in spite of a budget situation which does not match up to our ambitions these results will now enable us to approach the future positively and i would like to pick up on what mr gargani has just said that the commission made a statement regarding a mid-term assessment 
it stated that on the occasion of the report it must draw up in accordance with article of the european parliament and council decision it would carry out an assessment of the results of the programme and this assessment will also cover the financial resources in the context of the community financial perspectives 
if need be the report shall contain a proposal to amend the decision and this should be achieved by june 
ladies and gentlemen this is a formal commitment not just words on paper 
all this must lead us to intensify our action in favour of developing a common cultural area within which our cultures can flourish further in all their unique features in all their diversity but may also be mutually enriched and the other citizens of europe may participate fully in them 
the increased participation of our citizens is something i hope and pray for 
i would like this participation to be as extensive and productive as possible and i undertake to work to ensure that in the course of the five years covered by the programme it becomes a tangible reality 
i know that you as members of parliament in your own regions and countries are all going to work together with the programme participants so that all these small flowers as one member of parliament said go to make a vast multicoloured carpet 
i should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a factor of enrichment for our citizens both in personal as well as in social and economic terms but a right which it is our job to assert and also the hallmark of rediscovered interaction within the union 
it does not compete with the cultural policies implemented in the various member states 
such policies are necessary and i would like to see them developed further 
it simply adds to them complements them building a bridge between the various cultures of our various countries 
i feel therefore that extending and enriching european citizens' participation in culture is a crucial task one which justifies the efforts we make to achieve it and this is the yardstick against which we must measure the success of our programme and of our union 
a number of members of parliament have quite rightly raised this point 
if the union is purely an economic union then it is a stillborn project 
however if it is a union of culture civilisation and participation then it becomes a living thing 
this is the foundation ladies and gentlemen which i intend to develop and i shall take the following five areas into special consideration firstly providing creative people with opportunities of an innovative nature to allow their talent to find the support it deserves in our programme 
secondly encouraging exchanges mobility and training in the cultural sector 
thirdly promoting cooperation between cultural operators 
fourthly increasing audiences for culture with particular emphasis on attracting young people to culture and fifthly protecting the common cultural heritage on the european scale as well as the history of the peoples of europe and making them better known 
the new programme will i am sure in terms of its structure and organisation based on transparency efficiency and balance prove to be an instrument as successful as it is essential to our measures 
madam president i reiterate my thanks to parliament for its support and for once again having shown the importance it attaches to culture in the context of the union 
i am certain that it will not be disappointed having given us its support and i personally undertake to keep parliament informed as things progress of the various phases of the implementation of our measures and the measures of our citizens which i hope will be great measures for the future of the union 
thank you commissioner 
i think we can also thank the rapporteur once again 
the debate is closed 
the vote will take place at a.m. tomorrow 
mr president nine million cars are shredded and scrapped every year in europe 
even though they can no longer be driven these nine million cars may still be traded and moved across borders and not just intra-community borders but also those outside the union 
it is therefore only right that the european union should draw up community rules on how these nine million vehicles every year are to be recycled and processed 
we believe that the directive has a few weaknesses that we in the house should work on to produce a directive which is genuinely ground-breaking 
we therefore have a number of amendments 
i personally believe that the scope of the directive goes beyond its objective 
i do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive 
nor do i think that motorcycles should be included as the distinctive culture of recycling within the motorcycle industry obviates the need for a european directive in this area 
i am not looking for such rigidly high recycling quotas when it comes to special-purpose vehicles either 
i want special-purpose vehicles such as ambulances to have high recovery quotas 
this is my main concern in this matter 
in my opinion the directive solidly regulates the matter of accountability for how a car is disposed of in europe 
this can be left as the commission has proposed with the member states ensuring the appropriate collection points for draining cars 
this will involve for example disposing of more than million lots of used oil removing break fluid etc 
an important part of this directive is the issue of what to do with used parts 
what should we do with the shredded products 
we should not overlook the fact that although quotas are an important point in recycling and recovery they are by no means the only point 
do not forget that in the case of cars % of environmental impact comes through driving % through recovery and % through construction 
quotas are not therefore the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility just one of many 
of course we need to aim high but quotas must not become an end in themselves 
we must understand that the bigger picture is important when it comes to the environmental impact of cars 
i am far keener to see us move away from today's car weighing kg and driving an average of km to a future car capable of driving the same distance but weighing just kg 
this would at least mean kg times km less transportation 
this would represent real environmental progress because it would lead to a large reduction in co2 which if i have rightly understood the kyoto protocol is the important factor 
we therefore consider that in future vehicles which clearly and effectively use lightweight construction methods will produce less co2 and should receive preferential treatment in their combustion quotas 
we think they should 
may i say something about costs 
some say that all the costs should be borne by the manufacturers that this is only right and in the very best interests of the consumer 
however this can be seriously questioned as the manufacturers will pass on all the costs to consumers and acquire for themselves a state-sanctioned monopoly on recycling 
i can only warn you against consenting to this 
there are amendments which propose splitting the costs fifty-fifty between the manufacturer and the buyer of a new car 
the money from this pool system or however you want to picture it would mean that from all vehicles in circulation could be taken in without cost to the last holder 
this too is a particular desire of my group 
our proposal to split the costs has a crucial advantage namely that we won't be an immediate candidate for the court of justice when the directive is adopted 
the car industry is concerned about and half expecting repercussions which is a serious problem which we must address accordingly 
this is why i propose splitting the costs between the first holder and the manufacturer 
as for a ban on certain materials of course we need one 
a car has dangerous components which we must ban long-term 
this means that we need a pressure instrument 
the commission has put forward various proposals which are too stringent and we have come up with some alternatives 
there are a number of sound amendments 
this parliament has been given more authority so let us use it 
let us have the courage to put together a ground-breaking directive 
a directive which we put together just for the sake of it would not be worthy of this house 
i ask for your support 
mr president i almost feel like saying phew now that we have at last come to the second reading on this directive which has given us so much work and which has clearly also given a great deal of work to the rapporteur mr florenz 
i do not consider this directive to be at all satisfactory since it does not answer the real question over what is going to be done with vehicles which have already been abandoned and which today can only be removed at local authority expense i.e the taxpayers' expense 
vehicles already abandoned have also been abandoned by community legislation in that they are not taken into consideration either in the texts on emissions or in this text on end-of-life vehicles 
the only merit of this directive is that it looks to the future 
it has not however been possible to solve the problem of vehicles currently being used but which are already old and which cost far more to recycle 
i should also like to stress the need to maintain a flexible approach to recycling reuse and incineration as far as the new particularly light materials are concerned which make it possible to reduce vehicle consumption and therefore emissions 
this is a problem of compatibility between our directives on end-of-life vehicles and the former directives including the one on auto-oil which we voted on a few years ago 
we must therefore congratulate the committee on the environment public health and consumer protection on having the wisdom in order to make things perfectly clear to reintroduce the clause making an exception of the vintage cars which are part of our industrial and cultural heritage 
in conclusion let me say that this directive is not ambitious enough to solve the problems of present car numbers and it is rather hypocritical with regard to the fate reserved for the wrecks which still clutter our forests lakes and gardens 
the taxpayer is still footing the bill 
mr president commissioner reading the leaflets which have been distributed in recent weeks one would think that we were talking about the ultimate environmental catastrophe or the death of the car industry in europe 
neither is correct 
we simply must realise that the directive on the table is a sound directive 
it means ecological progress for europe and we can be proud of ourselves if we succeed in enacting it and setting it in motion 
all the same there is one point on which we are in conflict 
in the grand scheme of the directive it is perhaps a minor point but nevertheless a disputed one 
it concerns the issue of recycling costs 
here we find ourselves fundamentally at odds with last year's debate in the council when freedom from costs for the last owner and the issue of financing were lumped together and a question mark placed over whether the last owner should really be free from costs 
so who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disposed of 
for us this is straightforward in the case of new vehicles it should be the manufacturer since this will also compel manufacturers to design and build recyclable cars 
and what about vehicles which are already on the road 
let us look at an example 
rover in great britain if they were responsible for all end-of-life cars would actually be responsible for million cars within the european union and would immediately have to set aside eur million against recycling costs whereas a manufacturer from korea building similar cars would only have to shell out peanuts as a representative of deutsche bank put it 
such distortions in competition are not about environmental protection they simply affect investment potential and the jobs of those building cars in europe 
consequently for end-of-life vehicles we propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end-of-life vehicles in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from costs 
i can understand it when colleagues from countries which do not build cars advocate that manufacturers should pay the full whack and that they are not interested in the problem of distortions in competition when it comes to setting aside funds 
however i would ask these colleagues to show solidarity with the more than million people who make a living from building cars in europe so that these jobs can be secured in the future 
i am in favour of stringent environmental requirements as you know from the auto-oil programme and the debate on exhaust emissions but i believe that they should be the same for everyone 
mr president commissioner i think we need this directive 
firstly because it clearly stipulates the environmental objectives 
secondly because it can promote recycling which is important 
thirdly because it sets out a clear procedure to combat pollution caused by heavy metals 
this is also an important point 
the directive affords a european framework also to member states who already have systems in place and who wish to continue to use these 
so first of all we need to keep the recycling percentages at their present level 
this will of course provide the necessary incentive for technological innovation and for identifying ways of dealing with materials that we do not as yet know how to dispose of 
secondly we need to retain the details as they are included in the common position 
as from therefore all vehicles should be handed in at no cost to their last owners 
needless to say this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way 
is this too much of a burden 
there is however one thing we should not overlook 
the directive applies to complete cars that is to say cars with none of the essential components missing 
according to the experts few of these complete cars are of no value 
after all recycling and the re-use of components form part of a sector which is not necessarily loss-making 
quite the reverse in fact 
at present there is a whole raft of companies which make a living out of them and a decent one at that 
this directive encourages the whole of this sector 
it is a sector which comprises small and medium-sized businesses 
since in this case transport costs are high a system will have to be introduced which will need to be very much decentralised because transporting an end-of-life vehicle over a distance of more than km is not a profitable activity 
i think it is a good thing that this directive does not need to apply to historic vehicles and i think we ought to add this provision to it 
i think therefore that vintage cars ought to be exempt 
also it is a good thing that we should clearly lay the burden of responsibility with the manufacturer 
that is a basic principle which we must uphold 
as manufacturers are responsible for the design they can give a great deal of consideration to the environment at the conception phase 
we must also insist that the cost is borne wholly or largely by the manufacturer as stipulated in the common position 
i find this a well-balanced formula which does not preclude a number of other things 
i think we need to retain it 
this is why our group will remain as close to the common position as possible and will not alter its essence 
after all we are all aware how difficult it was within the council to bring this common position about and that it was a very difficult balancing act to reach this common position 
in my opinion we should not jeopardise that common position because it is a directive which we desperately need for environmental reasons 
i would ask you to support this common position 
our group will at any rate do this as far as possible for environmental reasons and because we have this directive which is well-balanced and encompasses a whole range of issues and difficulties including for example the way in which the costs are to be distributed 
mr president we need to take an important decision today 
packaging still accounts for a mountain of rubbish in europe and is a burden upon the environment 
some of the socialists under the direction of mr bernd lange say yes we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until or according to amendment no 
the common position stipulates 
according to the group of the greens this gives the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparations 
i would therefore urge my colleagues not to support amendment no of the christian democrats and amendment no of some of the socialists 
if car manufacturers need to bear the cost of recycling their cars they will design these cars in such a way that they can be re-used more easily and more cheaply 
the problem of plastic and pvc will then no longer exist in cars and these products will be replaced by plant-based bioplastic 
this is ultimately cheaper also for the consumer 
for twenty years the majority within parliament has attempted to make european environmental policy greener 
today this green position is being threatened under pressure from in particular the german and french car industries 
that is why i urge you to vote against amendments nos and 
we the green group by and large support the common position 
mr president the waste from end-of-life vehicles is one of our really major environmental problems in terms both of the quantity of waste and of emissions of environmentally hazardous substances 
if they were adopted many of the amendments which have been tabled would considerably weaken the directive 
it is easy to see that the car industry in certain countries for example in germany went in for some pretty tough lobbying before the present directive was adopted 
for ourselves it is crucial that the following principles should apply 
the polluter should pay 
this means that it is the manufacturer which should take full responsibility financial as well as otherwise for recycling vehicles 
there must be rules governing existing vehicles too 
there should be no falling-off in the percentages concerned or in the requirements for recycling vehicles from particular years and it is important to limit the use of dangerous substances such as lead 
we shall vote against any amendments which run counter to these considerations 
reference was made earlier on in the debate to the fact that some thought should be given to the millions of people who work in the car industry in various countries and to those countries which have large car industries for example my own country sweden 
i was myself a car worker before i was elected 
i believe i am one of the few members of this parliament to have stood beside a production line and assembled cars 
i think that very tough demands should be made of the car industry 
these would of course be to the advantage of modern progressive car manufacturers who think in environmentally friendly terms 
it is precisely this type of car industry which we should be encouraging in the european union 
mr president i am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this parliament as indeed it is for the citizens of europe 
there is no doubt that abandoned cars represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment 
our citizens expect us in this regard to protect their interests 
each year there are between and million vehicles scrapped within the european union 
this in itself generates a large amount of waste 
car manufacturers the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars 
we know that in the netherlands there are authorised treatment centres in place to collect end-of-life vehicles and this process should be extended across the length and breadth of the european union 
from an irish perspective i know that the irish department of the environment is already having consultations with motor industry representatives to ensure that appropriate collection centres are put in place in ireland in the near future to deal with end-of-life vehicles 
i see no reason why licensing arrangements cannot be organised across europe for collection centres to scrap the to million vehicles which are disposed of within the european union on an annual basis 
car manufacturers will have to provide information on the rate of re-use recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved in the coming years 
in accordance with new provisions included in the amsterdam treaty all the million consumers within the european union have a right to consumer-related information 
i believe eu consumers will support those car manufacturers that incorporate the most environmentally-friendly practices in the coming year 
my final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the european community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic considerations 
mr president the directive on end-of-life vehicles is certainly a milestone in the improvement of the environment in europe 
i also think that a great effort has been made to arrive at intelligent recycling of materials a reduction of polluting waste and the promotion of technological innovation 
in this regard we are certainly on the right track but as some members have already stressed the real issue here is the possibility that manufacturers' responsibility will become a shared responsibility 
i would like to say that in italy considerable headway has been made in this sector we are perhaps the first in europe to have regulations encouraging us to take end-of-life vehicles off the market but in our country the average age of cars on the road is rather high and we therefore have serious concerns over the problems that this directive could entail for the market 
we need to conduct a serious analysis of the matter 
in italy we have begun to withdraw and recycle around % of old cars but there is a market problem which could trigger a crisis in terms of unemployment given that in italy industry often resorts to lay-offs and redundancies and cause problems for workers in different parts of italy 
we must therefore try to reconcile the two requirements parliament is sometimes a little extremist adopting positions that are either extremely pro-green or extremely anti-green and all things considered find a way to combine the effort made by mr florenz and that of other members who are trying to reconcile the two positions as best as possible 
these worthwhile amendments are the outcome of this i think that we will be able to arrive at a solution to the problem that is to reconcile environmental requirements with market and labour requirements 
mr president this directive deals with the comparatively small but growing problem of abandoned cars and the question of a more structured disposal of all cars at the end of their life 
to that extent it might be thought desirable even if it is not a matter of urgent necessity 
the key questions now are who pays the eur per car for the million cars that are disposed of each year 
who pays for the collection the dismantling the disposal and so on 
and should the directive be retrospective to cover every car that has ever been made 
the proposal from the council the common position is that manufacturers should pay the lot 
that would mean billions of pounds or euros for each of the major companies in each of the countries of the european union 
that cost would inevitably be passed on to the price and hence to the buyers of new cars 
because european car manufactures have been operating here for many many more decades than companies from japan korea and elsewhere that would be a much greater burden on the older european companies and a competitive gift to their competitors from elsewhere 
i commend mr florenz mr lange and others who have sought from both sides of the party divide a compromise based on shared costs 
i also commend to you the amendment standing in my name and colleagues from germany italy ireland spain sweden and britain to remove the retrospective nature of this measure 
retrospective law is bad law it is unfair law and often it is unworkable law 
most democratic parliaments in the free world reject it on principle unless there is overwhelming public interest which clearly there is not in this case 
that is why i have called for a roll-call vote on this 
we can see who is prepared to vote for a retrospection which is of doubtful legality which would be a costly burden to every future car buyer and a devastating blow for the european car industry 
mr president once again i would like to briefly outline the economic issues involved in this directive and reaffirm my support for the amendments tabled by my colleague bernd lange 
these amendments actually have the advantage and i should like to stress this of reconciling environmental constraints and economic imperatives 
but as mr lange so rightly said this solution is totally unfair to european car manufacturers 
coming from a country which does have a car manufacturing industry i can tell you that it is not possible retroactively to impose on them the total financial costs for all vehicles of their makes currently on the road i.e effectively making them bear the costs arising from % of the total number of cars in europe 
this solution is unacceptable because these car manufacturers have not had the opportunity to build the environmental demands we are making of them today into their manufacturing procedures and their manufacturing costs 
the common position puts european car manufacturers in a disadvantageous position in relation to manufacturers which have just come to the european market 
of course we are not here to defend a particular national interest or a particular industrial lobby 
we are here to build a europe that is competitive on the world market and to safeguard jobs in economic sectors where we are actually competitive 
this is why i urge you to support the amendments tabled by bernd lange 
these amendments will be supported by the group of the party of european socialists since they effectively reconcile all the interests involved economic interests and environmental constraints while granting member states the freedom to select the means to implement these constraints since these amendments envisage that the systems in place in the members states and some of them work perfectly well will be able to continue to operate 
mr president commissioner the proposed directive on end-of-life vehicles before us today aims firstly to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the union but also to safeguard the proper operation of the internal market in this sector 
let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicles must of course be exempt from the scope of this directive 
cars are also part of our cultural heritage 
i think we would all agree on that 
having said that one of the stumbling blocks concerns article i.e the date on which the directive will come into force 
the european car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be recovered even though they were not designed for recycling 
the common position was more feasible since it envisaged for vehicles already on the road 
this would furthermore make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional expenses 
like my group i shall therefore support this aspect the common position which i feel offers a balanced compromise between constraints upon firms and essential advances in environmental protection 
mr president the european parliament is today facing an important decision 
will we give our backing to forward-looking environmental and consumer protection or as the amendments of florenz lange and others cause me to fear will we allow ourselves to become a servant of the german car industry 
the credibility of parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake 
it would be shameful to say the least if the european parliament were to draw back from the professions the governments of the member states and the european commission have been making concerning manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection 
the intention of florenz and lange in their amendments is obvious to sabotage the directive 
the proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation 
in setting up numerous hurdles their sole aim is to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by going down the road of type approvals they seek to delay the implementation of the directives by years or more 
this is totally unacceptable 
i therefore appeal to the german delegates in particular to prevent major political damage occurring today 
the red-green federal government has not exactly covered itself with glory in the debate on the end-of-life vehicles directive 
do not continue in this vein 
the whinging about competitive disadvantages is laughable if it only concerns competitive disadvantages sustained by the german car industry 
start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers 
vote in favour of environmental and consumer protection and for innovation in the car and recycling industry 
mr president this directive has been under discussion since 
it is high time that we reached an agreement 
since i more or less share the views of my colleague mr sjöstedt and the representative of the greens mr de roo i am not going to use the two minutes allotted to me and i will highlight just two issues 
firstly and this is perhaps the basic point of the proposal the idea which goes hand in hand with recycling and the use of waste that we should use materials which will subsequently cause less pollution 
another point is that waste should not be incinerated or crushed not only in the case of lead cadmium and mercury but also in the case of waste which contains pvc 
parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context 
the other question is who should bear the cost 
i agree with previous speakers who have said that the polluter should pay and this proposal expresses that idea very well 
producers must pay although we all know that the consumer will ultimately suffer the consequences of this and they must take responsibility for the costs before as some of the amendments propose 
we are more in agreement with the amendment proposed at first reading 
it is also important to set percentages and a date for vehicles to be composed of recyclable materials 
i believe that this proposal relies on very long deadlines 
lastly mr president i believe we should favour the creation of small and medium-sized businesses which if subject to rigorous approval and duly authorised can promote the creation of jobs in this very important area preventing the emergence of monopolies by large companies 
mr president today the european parliament must face up to real responsibilities 
we have to work out what we are going to do with the millions of vehicles we abandon each year 
in some of our member states voluntary environmental agreements have already been signed to ensure that our ditches canals and fields are not filled with these ugly and dangerous wrecks inhabited occasionally by an alarmed farmyard chicken 
i come of course from a country that is proud of its car industry and of its commercial success both in europe and in third countries 
i know of the proactive attitude of the european car manufacturing industry which has set up an extensive research programme to outline a national information system for dismantling end-of-life vehicles 
i am aware of the difficulties the council experienced in finding a compromise 
that is why today we must be understanding alchemists concerned for our environment 
this will either be the century of waste management or it will not 
the car industry increasingly more respectful of the environment has i am sure anticipated this kind of increasing awareness 
indeed it is accepting its responsibilities 
it is the member states however who will have to implement this directive and let us beware of going into too much detail because the industrial traditions the demolition and crushing sectors vary according to whether you are in italy or in finland 
i am opposed to making the car owners liable 
the men and women on the move throughout europe pay for their car and their catalytic converter pay their national taxes and the tax on fuel and are therefore already paying a high price for their magnificent machine and their freedom of movement 
it would certainly be unwise for my fellow members in the major groups of the federalist tendency to seek to make the european parliament unpopular in this way by creating a liability shared between the owner and the manufacturer 
how furthermore can a fund be created which will pay for vehicle recycling and manage operations within europe 
who is to pay for recycling the car i bought in france if i register it in belgium 
which national fund will pay for my end-of-life vehicle 
let us beware too of worrying the world of business with the legal uncertainty of an unacceptable retroactive application 
it is not our intention to start a punitive legislative campaign here today but to continue on our present course advocating sustainable development 
mr president most of the time the european parliament spearheaded by environment committees does its very best to make a critical assessment of the proposals submitted by the european commission or the council so as to improve on them from an environmental point of view 
now a sound common position submitted by the council is in danger of being changed for the worse from an environmental point of view here in parliament 
every year we discard a huge amount of cars which contain many dangerous substances 
this is why it is important to prevent waste materials 
we should also aim for minimum quantities of heavy metals as well as of other dangerous substances and materials 
in addition car manufacturers need to produce and build these cars in such a way as to facilitate simple dismantling and re-use 
what is left of the stripped vehicle also requires to be processed adequately 
i therefore welcome with open arms the percentage levels for re-use and recycling which have been proposed by the council 
these days the complete dismantling of end-of-life vehicles is economically viable 
this means that we move away from shredding 
the prescribed objectives are most certainly viable and in the netherlands a value of % recycling has now already been achieved 
the processing cost can then be incorporated in the price of new cars 
the proposals made by a few meps impact greatly on this system 
the so-called shared liability is very cumbersome and does not stimulate innovation 
if the system of delivering cars to treatment facilities without any cost is applied it will also transpire that the cost of processing will come down considerably 
finally this directive should enter into force at the earliest opportunity 
a laborious conciliation procedure would entail an unnecessary delay at the expense of the environment 
why cannot we just be satisfied with the common position currently tabled 
if we are then all that remains for us to do is to congratulate the council on the result achieved 
mr president i hold mr florenz in high esteem 
he has delivered excellent work under pressure both from his colleagues and from the car industry 
add to this the fact that he had to do this from his green approach and against that background find a compromise 
that was not easy 
overall i am not dissatisfied with the present common position and certainly not with the philosophy underlying that common position 
i would like to comment on two things 
firstly vintage cars and motorbikes 
these should indeed be excluded from the directive 
secondly the controversial question as to who bears the responsibility for taking back cars 
i do not wish to alter the text of the common position in any way 
in my opinion there is too much initial hesitation 
the car lobby has led too many people up the garden path 
i would also like to mention that experience has nonetheless taught us that the processing cost is in fact passed on 
these costs are not very high 
in the member state where i come from you are talking about guilders per car 
if you charge this from day one you can process the old cars straight away 
a very large industry might then emerge which would ensure that scrapyards which used to be a common feature in our member states would then disappear 
i do not wish to make any changes to this particular aspect of the compromise 
i think it would be a good thing if we were to approve the present legislation together as soon as possible 
this is positive because in that way the nine million cars which are introduced each year onto european roads will actually be processed appropriately and this will benefit us all 
mr president the present directive is important in so far as it helps prevent our being faced with hazardous waste from end-of-life vehicles and in so far as it promotes the re-use and recycling of materials from scrapped cars 
i therefore think it is crucial for the environment that the ban on using poisonous heavy metals should be fully implemented and that we should not reduce manufacturers' liability 
if we do reduce it we remove from manufacturers the incentive to design and produce cars which give rise to less waste 
i therefore find it incomprehensible and very curious to see amendments from members of the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy the objectives of which are to weaken the environmental requirements and significantly reduce car manufacturers' liability 
if these amendments are adopted i think that we shall cause parliament seriously to lose credibility on environmental issues 
so far we here in parliament have been positive catalysts for environmental protection but now if the amendments proposed by mr florenz and mr lange are adopted we are to become a negative factor for the environment in europe 
what is more if we reduce manufacturers' liability on this issue this will also have serious consequences for subsequent matters in other areas for example the forthcoming directive on scrap from computers and other electronic equipment 
i would therefore recommend to members of parliament that we cut across party lines and vote against all the amendments to the common position which would weaken environmental standards and reduce manufacturers' liability 
we shall then be able to achieve an environmentally respectable result 
mr president this excellent directive will end the dumping of old cars encourage recycling and above all encourage manufacturers to design cars which can easily be recycled 
now who should pay the costs 
whatever system is adopted ultimately the cost will be passed on to the consumer 
the best way of achieving our environmental objectives is to make the manufacturers our instrument both for collecting the money and for disposing and recycling of the cars 
the manufacturers have tricked mr florenz and mr lange into tabling amendments here which seriously weaken these proposals 
do not be fooled by the car manufacturers 
if you want the full benefits of this directive use your vote to throw out these amendments 
mr president commissioner this debate is not a technical debate contrary to what we may think 
it has become eminently political 
yesterday we honoured our institution with a political debate 
today if members of parliament yield to the strength of the lobbying of some car manufacturers we should be doing ourselves dishonour 
in expecting consumers to bear half the cost of the recovery of end-of-life vehicles as amendment no stipulates even though the common position states that all recovery costs should be borne by the manufacturer parliament would for the first time not be acting as the defender of the rights of the consumers and citizens of europe it would be turning into mere sounding box for different lobbies 
we cannot accept this 
it would be a precedent which would open the door to all sorts of pressure in many other areas 
it would also be the first time that the european parliament would be weakening a council position whereas usually we are complaining that their position is not strong enough 
the free recovery system for example for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly 
it is as it stands perfectly acceptable 
mr president like so many others here today i believe this is a good measure 
this is a useful measure and it is one which we all need 
most of the technical issues have been resolved 
there are some details to be finalised but most of the technical issues have been resolved 
we have arrived at the final question 
in the first reading debate it was only the economic and monetary affairs committee which asked this question and it was only myself as the draftsman of the opinion of that committee who posed that question in parliament 
that is quite simply who pays 
the council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost not all of it as mr bowis has mistakenly said 
in fact perhaps as little the lawyers tell us as % or one-fifth of the cost 
that is not unreasonable 
if you look at the uk consumer for example who buys a rover as mr lange has indicated or for that matter any other make of car in the uk and who has for years been paying excessive prices for those cars over and above comparable prices in other parts of europe why should they pay 
they have paid already 
why should the very same people as taxpayers or as future car buyers pay again to dispose of the vehicle that the manufacturer has made the profit from 
i cannot accept that 
there are amendments here today that are proposing that should be the case 
i cannot accept it and i will not vote for it 
the responsibility for these cars lies with the manufacturer 
it is the manufacturer who has to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal 
the common position does not preclude the possibility of contributions being made by government 
the common position is a reasonable compromise 
some of the amendments today are totally unreasonable in that they take away completely the responsibility from the car manufacturer of paying a little if any of the cost of disposal of cars on the road 
i cannot accept that and on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers of europe i am voting against those amendments 
mr president there is agreement that we must give some thought as to how we in europe will properly deal with end-of-life cars although in this instance the council has not provided a model for a suitable european environment policy 
it is disgraceful the way in which the german presidency handled this matter 
firstly herr trittin the environment minister was not in tune with his colleagues in the cabinet then chancellor schröder blundered in like a bull in a china shop having no expert knowledge of this process 
mind you even the resolution of the finnish council presidency in june was not the best result that could have been done achieved 
there are certain weaknesses the greatest of which in my opinion is that not enough consideration is being given to the situation of small businesses after all the car industry is more than just large companies 
it is in the area of supply that small business plays an important role and we must not fail to also take account of the interests of those employed in small and medium-sized enterprises 
for there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector 
the plight of small businesses is also addressed by numerous amendments from the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy and also the amendments in question from our group to article concerning costs 
the common position is also no great shakes from an environmental viewpoint 
it fails to take in the bigger picture and when my fellow delegate from the greens says that this is the first time that the european parliament has toned down a common position i really must object because quite simply it is not environmentally meaningful to restrict the use of modern low-consumption cars such as the 3-litre car which contain a great deal of plastic by means of rigid high recycling quotas 
consequently we must support an amendment which at least permits exceptions in the case of particularly economical cars 
the objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation 
however the arguments of the plastics and car industries would be more persuasive if a commitment were to be given to reducing co2 levels in europe in other sectors besides these 
mr president we are indeed now in a very rare situation those who wish to uphold environmental values will take the side of the council in their common position 
in contrast to what the previous speaker said i can say i am really proud that a common position was achieved during the finnish presidency to uphold environmental values 
if we slide away from the common position and try to divide the recycling costs we will be creating a loophole we will not have created a rational clear system in which the division of responsibilities is in order 
that is why in my opinion the manufacturer must take the greatest share of the responsibility 
only then will we find an adequate solution to the problem taking into consideration the fact too that the manufacturer should be encouraged to make vehicles whose parts can be recycled at the smallest possible cost in the future 
there is the risk of creating a monopoly within the car dismantling trade 
this particularly applies in areas within the eu where distances are great and where a lot of small companies are involved in dismantling vehicles 
unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers would also be in danger of creating a situation in which the market for used car parts disappears for manufacturers would have a greater responsibility to sell new parts 
yet the trade in used car parts is important especially for those who collect and renovate older vehicles 
the principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers is also dubious in terms of the principles governing the market economy 
it should be possible for changes to be made to companies and for the latter to be sold and wound up 
they should be able to establish themselves in new markets but also to leave old markets 
to bind manufacturers by means of a liability which can extend very far back in time ill accords with a flexible market economy designed to promote development 
it conflicts with established economic and legal principles retroactively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for its product 
over the years a consumer may have altered the product in a number of ways 
every country within the eu now has rules governing the scrapping of cars 
some may be better than others and some worse 
this does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds 
mr president everyone agrees with the obvious environmental and industrial importance of the instrument in question 
the common position offers an acceptable compromise but its rather delicate and precarious nature somewhat restricts the opportunities for improvement and puts the whole directive at risk 
i therefore maintain that parliament cannot force the issue and it would be paradoxical for it to do so in the context of redefining the environmental scope of the instrument 
i would remind you that car manufacturers have admitted that they can live with the directive the costs are not excessive recycling a car costs less than % of the price of a new car 
moreover the manufacturers will not be financially accountable until when a good number of the existing vehicles will no longer be on the market 
as for the remaining vehicles we could nevertheless provide for some means of sharing costs as is proposed in amendments nos and by mr lange the only ones that seem compatible with the balancing of the common position and with the trials underway in some countries and we should therefore support them 
mr president this is an extremely bad directive 
first of all as my colleague mr bowis has pointed out it is retrospective and that is wrong in principle 
secondly it dumps huge costs on the european motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment 
in this parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in europe and yet we constantly pass measures which will have the effect of reducing employment 
i suggest to you that the directive is bad in another respect which has not been examined well enough in this debate 
it is like so much european legislation 
it is far too prescriptive 
it sets in stone one particular model of recycling 
the production line was invented about a hundred years ago i believe by henry ford and what we are proposing to do here is to create a sort of nineteenth century production line in reverse to dismantle vehicles to take the pieces apart and seek to recycle them 
one thing we should stop and think about is the fact that there is a very uncertain market for recycled plastic bumpers of cars 
the plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so 
there is already a very successful industry out there which is shredding cars recovering metals and recovering energy by the incineration of the non-metallic parts 
this is a very environmentally reasonable approach 
it is just as good environmentally to burn old plastic as to burn new oil for energy recovery 
this method of disposal of cars carries no cost and so would eliminate the whole issue of who pays because the dead car would actually have a small value going into the recycling and reclamation process 
i would oppose this directive on the basis that it is too prescriptive it ignores what is actually going on in the car recycling market at the moment and it sets in stone methods which are not necessarily the best environmentally and are certainly very damaging economically 
mr president the common position is sound but it is up to parliament to improve the common position on end-of-life vehicles 
the social-democratic group has submitted a few important proposals for improvement over the past couple of days 
i would especially draw your attention to amendment no in which a choice is made in favour of laying the cost of disassembly and recycling at the door of the manufacturer for new cars at any rate 
consequently consideration will also be given to recycling during the conception phase and production 
for the cars currently on the road it would be reasonable to share the cost for example by setting up a fund such as that in the netherlands 
the common position stipulates that manufacturers should not only bear the cost they should also take back end-of-life vehicles 
this is a big problem in my opinion 
i urge that car manufacturers should most definitely not be given the task of organising the dismantling and recycling of vehicles as they would gain an excessive hold over the second-hand components market 
they would then determine their own prices 
anyone who has been in an old car knows that this is to the detriment of the consumer and the amateur mechanic 
the european consumer organisation which has asked us to support the common position on this point is to my mind letting the consumer down 
a second argument for keeping the dismantling of cars out of the manufacturers' clutches is the cost of transport 
if car manufacturers all set up their own dismantling companies this will necessitate transporting end-of-life vehicles over long distances 
this is environmentally unfriendly but also expensive and does not benefit the consumer either 
i would therefore appreciate your support for amendment no 
mr president commissioner i have asked to speak again so that i can say a few more words at the close of this debate 
if you travel to the netherlands you will find that every last owner can get rid of his car cost-free 
you will also find that these cars are suitably disposed of that new material flows have been opened up in order to recycle materials that % of the weight of a car is recycled and that % of all cars in the netherlands are recycled 
this is financed by a fund to which the buyer of a new car contributes 
should this be condemned ecologically frau breyer 
i do not think so 
the netherlands has an exemplary model for disposing of cars as per the wishes of the directive and the issue of whether the buyer of a new car should pay or in the case of end-of-life vehicles currently driving around the manufacturer has nothing absolutely nothing to do with ecology it is a simple question of competition 
the issue here is whether a european manufacturer should pay eur million or a korean manufacturer say eur million 
in terms of the people who build cars here in europe i am in favour of not making competition unequal but in terms of environmental protection i want freedom from costs for the last owner to be financed by a special fund and manufacturer responsibility for new cars which will force them to assume responsibility for building recyclable cars 
mr president the proposal we are discussing has a huge amount of advantages mainly in the interests of preventing waste and encouraging re-use the recovery and recycling of components and the recovery of materials etc 
i think we have tabled a sound proposal 
the main thread of the discussion is about whether or not the manufacturer the vendor or whoever should take the end-of-life vehicle back without any cost 
i will only give the example of my own country to illustrate how this system functions there without any problems 
we have reached an agreement with all the parties involved 
these include car manufacturers second-hand car dealers the federation of the car industry the metal processing firms shredding firms and the government 
an environmental policy agreement has been signed on a voluntary basis 
the car industry and belgium produces a great many cars- did not have any problem with that 
belgians can deliver their cars back to the vendor without any cost 
in connection with this we have noticed how quite contrary to what has been said here to the effect that the scheme would be to the detriment of employment a number of small businesses have taken the recycling of materials to heart and are doing very well 
some businesses have become hi-tech businesses because they managed to recycle certain materials even materials which are not yet included in the directive 
so this means that we are developing a new sector and new employment and doing the environment a huge favour into the bargain 
i am in favour of collection free of charge 
it worked for us 
why would it not work elsewhere 
mr president ladies and gentlemen thank you for an interesting debate in which many important arguments have been presented 
would you be so kind as to bear with me for a few minutes 
allow me briefly to comment on some of the assumptions and principles behind the present directive 
allow me also to begin by commenting on and responding to a couple of the most important arguments in this debate 
first of all i think i should repeat some of the basic facts which mr florenz and others have already mentioned 
what we are discussing here is the fact that close on ten million cars are scrapped every year in the european union resulting in approximately as many millions of tons of waste 
this means that almost ten million tons of waste are created by these cars and approximately seven per cent of the latter are abandoned out in the open 
moreover they constitute environmentally hazardous substances of the worst kind 
approximately ten per cent of lead production is to be found in cars but also cadmium chromium mercury and other very dangerous substances 
this is something you already know but i would nonetheless also repeat it for the benefit of those who are listening 
cars are one of the fastest growing sources of waste we have in europe 
we know that waste from cars exists and we know how we ought to be dealing with it and there is no excuse for not taking action 
the present directive has three aims 
first of all we want to stop heavy metals from being used in the manufacture of new cars 
secondly we want to establish the fact that the manufacturer is liable 
instead we should avoid creating so much waste 
we should see to it that we recycle as much as possible of the various contents of a product 
thirdly we wish to achieve the recycling objectives specified in the present directive 
these are the three most important aims of the directive 
this is of course because it is a waste of resources for us not to ensure that materials in cars are recycled 
two important questions have arisen in this regard 
yes there are in fact more than two questions but i want to mention just two of the most important 
first of all who should pay 
the first question then is about who should pay 
it is nonetheless clear that the cost will be borne jointly by manufacturers and consumers 
we have calculated that the cost of recycling cars does not constitute more than one per cent of the price of a new car 
do we imagine then that the cost would disappear if we were not to adopt this directive 
no 
clearly we shall all have to bear the cost of serious damage to the environment but it will be very much greater 
moreover the cost will have to be borne in the future 
the cost will not therefore disappear but now we are clarifying whose liability it is and how the cost is to be distributed 
are we therefore talking about a car industry in crisis 
is it an unprofitable industry which we are discussing and which we really have to help by not imposing more taxes upon it 
is it the case that the car industry definitely cannot afford these 
is it the case that the motives behind the proposed measures are in actual fact concerned with reducing the competitiveness of the european car industry 
no of course not 
it is quite the opposite 
do you believe that consumer demand for environmentally friendly cars and more fuel-efficient cars is going to decline in the future 
what kind of requirements do you think our children and grandchildren and future legislators are going to make of cars 
naturally that they should be environmentally friendly that they should be recyclable that they should be fuel-efficient and that they should not pollute our environment 
it is of course only in this way that we can create a future for the car industry 
we must create forms of motive power which are not damaging to health and which are of such a kind that we can deal with the relevant waste recycle materials and compete by means of environmentally friendly and fuel-efficient cars 
the fact that we have a european car industry which has already made great strides more than properly compensates for the fact that there are in fact a good many cars on european roads for which they must take responsibility 
the cost is not insurmountable nor is the task an impossible one 
if we develop motive power of the kind i have described i am quite certain that market forces and commercial interests in the car industry will ensure that mechanisms develop for dealing with both the cost and the workload 
these will consist of everything from insurance to sensible and effective scrapping and recycling systems 
the industry itself will ensure that these systems are introduced in europe 
they will not represent an insurmountable cost for the european car industry 
they will instead help industry to be in the vanguard of eventually producing environmentally friendly and more fuel-efficient cars 
we must do this for the sake of the environment 
the costs will not disappear 
nor will the waste disappear 
but otherwise we must all of us as taxpayers or citizens foot the bill 
what is more the costs will be higher the longer we wait before taking action 
that is what i should like to say by way of introduction 
i also want to comment on the question as to whether there is to be any retroactive legislation 
if we assume that on average a car has a life of eleven years do members indeed does anyone believe that we should wait for eleven years before we get to grips with this problem 
do you think that when we legislate about chemicals we should say that we are ignoring those chemicals which are already on the market and that we are legislating only for what is to be produced in the future 
clearly we must consider the problem which exists here and now and the challenge presented by the existing range of cars 
it is still not an insurmountable problem 
we can deal with it 
we already have an infrastructure 
we have what we require in order to deal with end-of-life cars 
if i have not already done so i would also thank mr karl-heinz florenz for the hard work he has put into this proposal on the committee on the environment public health and consumer policy 
i believe it will have very positive and noticeable effects on the environment 
we cannot continue to close our eyes to these matters 
as i have said we have both the knowledge and the resources to cope with these issues 
however we obtained a well-balanced common position in july during the finnish presidency 
now we must ensure that the present legislative process is concluded successfully 
a total of amendments have been tabled 
the commission can adopt amendments in their entirety 
three amendments can be partially approved and one can be approved in principle 
this applies to amendment no excluding section and section and section and 
these amendments can all be approved 
amendments nos and are new the commission can approve these 
the commission can also approve amendment no with certain editorial changes 
they cannot therefore be approved 
parliament has traditionally made a major contribution to strengthening environmental legislation in europe 
it would amaze and depress me if it were not to do so today 
i am very concerned about certain amendments from parliament which bring the absolutely basic pillars of the present proposal into question 
i want to deal with these amendments on a group-by-group basis 
amendments nos and concern the phasing-out of heavy metals 
amendment no involves a delay of at least ten years in bringing the provision into force 
amendments nos and involve introducing unnecessary conditions and exceptions 
this would mean that the process of replacing dangerous substances would be implemented more slowly 
amendments nos and mean that heavy metals have to be separated from the waste before recycling 
the commission considers that the type of phasing-out proposed in the common position is easier to apply from a technical point of view 
the compromise reached by the council is fair but fragile 
the commission does not consider that the amendments would improve the balance without at the same time creating tensions 
this does not impose disproportionate costs upon manufacturers 
far from it 
amendments nos and concern quantified objectives 
the high level of protection aimed at by the common position would be very much undermined if the recycling objective for the year were removed 
these amendments would also make the objectives awkward to deal with and difficult to supervise 
allow me also listen carefully to what i am saying now because i have heard this reiterated in the debate allow me to comment on the issue of vintage and cherished cars as mentioned in amendments nos and section and 
such vehicles are not covered by the definition of waste and are not therefore included under the directive 
so whatever has been stated in this regard vintage cars and motorcycles are not included under the directive 
we do not consider that amendments nos and add anything to the directive 
this is not covered by the directive 
an ad hoc directive should therefore be demanded from the european parliament and the council 
amendments nos and water down the requirements concerning the dismantling of vehicles 
there is a danger of amendments nos and reducing the chances of recycling plastic tyres and glass 
finally the commission cannot approve amendments nos and for reasons to do with legal clarity nor amendment no which the commission considers to be unnecessary at this stage 
thank you very much commissioner 
the debate is closed 
we shall now proceed to the vote 
madam president as you know the reason we are voting this report today rather than last week is because of the numerous and serious translation errors particularly in the french version 
you have received a letter of complaint from me about the number of mistakes in this report and in other reports with which i have had dealings recently 
there is an error which has still not been corrected and that is on amendment no 
in the english version we refer to pharmaceutical and scientific organisations 
could you please make sure that french-speaking members of this house know that the word entreprises is not correct 
it should not be in the amendment 
and again i urge you madam president to look at the standard of translation that we are receiving currently 
madame mcnally in general i am myself rather concerned at the increasing number of problems we are having with the translations 
i shall consult the parliamentary services to see how we can find a solution 
madam president i would simply like to point out that during the procedure we were not allowed either to table or consequently adopt amendments in the committee 
i do not know whether this is in order and i would therefore ask you to verify the accuracy of the procedure which was followed before this report reached the house 
i have taken note of your comment mr speroni 
madam president we simply have a few translation problems in this area too 
we consider the english version to be the original text 
to give you an example in both paragraphs and of the dutch and german versions the equivalents of the english words in so far as have been omitted 
this is why i would ask you to consider the english version as the original version 
thank you mr van velzen 
in response i shall say the same thing i said to mrs mcnally just now 
i am very concerned about these translation problems which unfortunately we seem to be having increasingly and i can assure you that we shall look into the matter very seriously indeed 
in any case the authoritative version is always of course the original language version 
madam president the socialist group proposes the following oral amendment 
i shall read it in english which is the original language of the resolution 
condemns mr haider for his insults towards certain eu member states and their leaders in the last few days in statements which foreign minister schüssel has failed to condemn 
in this document the commission proposes to stimulate debate with a view to promoting the increased participation of women in research in europe 
this objective deserves our total support 
expenditure on research and technology actually forms a sizeable part of the budget of the european union after agriculture and the structural funds 
the various framework programmes have enabled not only high quality scientific work to take place but also innovative cooperation between researchers in various member states 
relatively few women however are active in scientific disciplines despite the excellent results they achieve in their studies 
it is unacceptable for women to continue to be underrepresented 
i am therefore delighted to see the proposals of the european commission 
the commission document sets out to focus on the initiatives to be taken at community level especially through the fifth framework programme for research and technical development which is quite obviously something i approve of 
furthermore like the rapporteur i think that studies must be undertaken to analyse the reasons for the gap between the number of women with science degrees and the number of women who manage to have a career in these fields 
improved analysis of the obstacles facing women will make it possible to develop a strategy to eliminate those obstacles 
we will have to enlist the support of the many existing networks of women scientists and to obtain their assistance in framing a joint research policy 
the european parliament will continue to carefully monitor the implementation of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development as regards the promotion of women and to come up with ideas for the course of the fifth framework programme for research and technical development 
we must incorporate the gender factor in science research and all other european union policies in order to put an end to the structural discrimination which prevents women competing on equal terms in the labour market 
in its communication women and science the european commission informs us of its good intentions of enlisting the support of women to enrich research in europe 
this is very good and we are pleased to see it 
the fact is there are too few women involved in research work in the european union 
we know that we can change this situation in which women are underrepresented in the science sector only by means of a policy of educational guidance which will systematically encourage a greater range of career choices for girls and when they have obtained their degrees by means of positive measures at the professional level 
this is patently not the case since such a quota would not be realistic 
indeed the report does not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieved 
it is not a quota 
it is a perfectly legitimate declaration of intent from the commission insofar as it concerns its own programmes and not those of member states 
the latter would be well advised however to follow the good example of the commission for once and make the same efforts in their own research programmes 
people must realise this 
on this subject any improvement in bringing the concept of equal opportunities to bear in everyday reality is indeed desirable and i can only welcome the implementation of a policy which would contribute towards satisfying the legitimate aspirations of women to enjoy equal access to scientific study to obtain positions of responsibility truly in line with their results and competence and to have accompanying measures drawn up rapidly enabling them to reconcile their family life and their career 
this necessary realistic and pragmatic policy however which will have to be associated with the elimination of the practical obstacles identified as unquestionable factors in this inequality must as far as we are concerned necessarily be based on the idea of complementarity which is the only one capable of justifying a proactive policy on the subject 
our thinking and our future actions must focus on respecting these values which truly respect gender differences not on some postulated sexual equality which has its own intrinsic contradictions 
by having the opportunity to show their true merit by eliminating as far as possible the barriers associated to the specifics of their condition as women and not in the context of a conflict in which women seem to be attacking male privilege women will demonstrate the benefits to be gained by facilitating a situation where their professional careers may flourish 
in this way they will succeed in altering balances which are still not in their favour 
madam president today in the second reading we have voted on the amendments to the directive on end-of-life vehicles 
i come from a country which manufactures % of the cars in the eu and it is precisely the free collection of end-of-life cars which is so financially onerous and unacceptable 
here in my opinion the labour market is also considerably burdened by the costs arising to these companies 
this cannot be a good thing in a european union where we are ever mindful of employment 
i consider that this is a serious defect and that in principle it does not befit our legal system 
in my opinion this directive is unacceptable for this reason 
madam president i would like to comment on the florenz report 
unfortunately there has been a toning down of the effective ecological material flow policy i.e through the obligatory risk assessment of materials whose harmful effect on health has been known for years 
we know that lead mercury cadmium and hexavalent chromium present high toxic and health risks and numerous community directives have succeeded in restricting their usage without any risk assessment being made 
here unfortunately the european parliament has bowed to the interests of industry 
i am nevertheless extremely pleased that there was no majority for the amendments of florenz lange and others who have actually sought to lever out manufacturer responsibility and make consumers solely responsible for the cost of environmentally compatible disposal of end-of-life vehicles 
i found this to be an extremely shameful attempt and i am pleased that it failed that the attempt by one large government and the delegates of a large member state did not gain a majority by which i mean the attempt to dominate the voting process of the european parliament on grounds of the interests of its national industries 
madam president although i too have spent most of my life in fast cars i agree with my colleague mr florenz that the directive on scrapping cars must make it clear that vintage cars are not included 
these splendid cars do not constitute waste 
that is why i voted in favour of the amendments 
in this way vehicles of historic value can be preserved for future generations 
we cannot forget old car enthusiasts either of whom there are more than in finland alone 
they are involved in low-profile work of valuable cultural importance 
before the vote at the plenary sitting new amendments have been tabled such as have already been voted down by the committee 
we need a directive in this area and we also therefore want to avoid a complicated conciliation procedure 
the directive concerning end-of-life vehicles will stand as an example for future legislation 
this should not in any way be jeopardised 
there are however two considerations which must certainly be dealt with within this text 
first of all who is to bear the financial costs of this destruction 
we must all ensure that it is not always the same person i.e the vehicle owner who pays 
he or she already pays enough in taxes for this vehicle which is a bottomless pit in financial terms 
we should apply this principle rationally and calmly correctly targeted and without ideology 
another essential point that must be included in this text is the express exclusion of vintage vehicles from its scope 
one might make the claim that there is no need to state it explicitly in writing because it is an obvious point but i feel that it is a point that should be made in writing because there is every interest in adopting clear texts 
so let us vote for these amendments in order to preserve these gems of the automobile industry 
these old vehicles are testimony to a culture and a passion which should be recognised and respected by europe if we are not to water down each of our specific identities 
there is no lack of examples amongst european texts and we all know how much debate and argument is caused by a lack of clarity and precision 
the precise wording of texts provides a guarantee and legal certainty for those people who will have to apply or live by these texts on a daily basis 
it is not the job of the mep to generate litigation or legal proceedings for judges in any arena 
that would not be fulfilling our mission 
on the contrary we must adopt crystal-clear texts in order to limit legal disputes 
 
i regret that the manufacturers have harangued the european parliament and the council with a whole ream of arguments which either cut no ice or were simply false 
i dare say this because i took the trouble to go into the field and collect information from among others scrapyards which already recycle car components successfully 
they made it clear to me that the arguments concerning lack of safety for example are nonsense 
the car lobby was unsuccessful today and i am pleased about that 
the directive remains in place 
i expect that we will achieve an excellent result in the reconciliation and that the efforts to achieve a better living environment will triumph over unreasonable industrial requirements 
my party opposed this measure and the proposed amendments 
there are few things more certain in life than taxes death and pollution 
however there is also nothing more certain than eu environmental directives which have laudable intentions but which actually fail to achieve their stated objectives 
when it comes to pollution like sin we are all against it but from there it is a far cry from believing that just because a measure is proposed against this evil it is necessarily good 
in fact this directive like so many others addressing environmental issues is not good 
as is so often the case it merely provides yet another massive bureaucratic structure to control a problem which will only serve to create more jobs for officials and cost the motor industries and consumers a great deal of money 
the one thing it will not do is solve the problem it is a massive sledgehammer to miss a nut 
no one not least my party could begin to disagree that recycling should be encouraged but the best way to achieve that is to work with the market not to create another bureaucratic monstrosity 
thus a more appropriate way to encourage recycling is to tax manufacturers who do not increase the amounts of recoverable material in their vehicles to encourage private sector recycling companies through a package of tax incentives and assistance on complying with environmental requirements and to incentivise the use of recycled materials 
of course these are areas where the eu does not have any jurisdiction and nor should it have such jurisdiction 
however in the absence of these powers it should not seek to substitute a less effective measure 
instead it should leave member states to develop their own systems and avoid the tendency to interfere where it is not wanted and can do no good 
this proposal for a directive attempts to establish conditions for the posting of workers who are third-country nationals for the provision of cross-border services 
third-country nationals with a permanent right of residence in one member state do not enjoy the right to freedom of movement within the european union 
until now the restrictions on the freedom of movement within the union of non-community workers have been very harsh 
it is therefore a positive step that the movement of workers within the european union is being made easier even when they are nationals of third countries 
nevertheless the proposal for a directive merely aims to allow them to move to another member state when they are posted there by an employer based in their country of normal residence 
this means that their scope for movement is limited to the duration of their posting and only to the member state to which they were posted 
on the other hand for the sake of simplifying procedures some highly debatable amendments have been included in the berger report one example of which is the establishment of a common information service for cards issued by a body in any member state 
it is with the greatest satisfaction that i welcome the two proposals for directives intended to facilitate the freedom of movement of workers who are nationals of a third country while facilitating the freedom of movement of services 
basically these proposals introduce the eu service provision card which will in future enable almost million third country nationals legally resident in a european union member state to provide services in other member states a phenomenon currently obstructed by problems such as the need to obtain visas and work permits 
the first proposal for a directive will authorise businesses established in a member state which employ workers who are third country nationals to assign such employees to another member state on a temporary basis to provide services there 
according to the terms of the directive the employer would be simply required to request a service provision card for each employee concerned 
logically in order to be given such a card the employee must be legally resident in a member states and must be covered by a social security scheme 
the second proposal grants the same rights to self-employed workers who are third country nationals 
while basically i subscribe to the european commission proposals nonetheless there are some conditions which may lead to confusion 
that is why i am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur 
this will make it possible to clarify the terms and thus prevent any misreading 
other amendments are intended to simplify the administrative procedures for example by authorising member states to designate a single authority responsible for issuing cards 
i feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the sort of administrative unwieldiness which too often acts as a brake on the proper application of new conditions 
i can therefore only be delighted at the adoption of these directives thus amended 
we could not really tolerate much longer a situation in which people legally resident within the european union had to face so many problems 
this goes against the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrined in the founding treaties of this union 
how can we talk of increasing the sphere of competence of the court of first instance when we know that we need to increase the number of judges in that court because it is overstretched 
the first measure would in fact cancel out the effects of the latter 
on january the council went back on the decision to increase the number of judges laid down in article of the accession treaty of june 
so what was done at amsterdam 
in that respect nothing 
you will agree furthermore that the texts adopted by this house always call for community jurisdiction and that includes for the charter of fundamental rights which is currently being drawn up 
the increase in the number of cfi judges from to and the opportunity it has recently been accorded to have a single judge rule on specific cases are not real solutions but mere decoys grudgingly granted which we have become aware of after the fact 
consequently these proposals do not live up to the issues at stake 
they represent a downward spiral which in the long term would require the number of judges to be increased to several hundred 
we cannot agree to this since such a sidelong shift towards a europe of the judges is detrimental to the proper exercise of democracy in our states 
the time has come we feel for in-depth consideration of how to put the community system of jurisdiction in order and to guarantee a fitting quality of justice 
this question cannot be dealt with separately from the current thinking on the hierarchy of norms and the better application of the principle of subsidiarity 
is the forthcoming intergovernmental conference not the ideal opportunity for this 
we nonetheless consider that the agenda for the intergovernmental conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for enlargement to take place 
we also argued this in november and we would therefore refer to our explanation of vote of november 
 
this determination to override nations with a legally supranational text is also expressed in the first meetings of the body responsible for drawing up the so-called charter of fundamental rights which is really a closet constitution 
it is expressed again in the unbelievable excess perpetrated by the european parliament which today in its vote on a resolution wished to cancel out the result of the free elections in austria 
the same determination to reduce nations to the level of mere administrative regions is also evident on every page of the opinion issued by the commission for the intergovernmental conference 
incidentally the french will probably be interested to learn that the commission is asking for article of the amsterdam treaty to be amended in order to establish majority voting and codecision with the european parliament 
people will remember that this article dealing with the transfer of immigration policy to the community level stipulated that for five years decisions would still be taken by unanimous vote in the council and thereafter the council would assess a potential opportunity to amend the system 
in france both in the national assembly and in the senate when this was being ratified many members of the french parliament were reassured to hear that in any case the council would remain free to choose and could retain unanimous decision-making 
well today the same minister of european affairs who drew up the treaty of amsterdam who has in the meantime become a european commissioner mr barnier proposes to decide at the forthcoming igc that the council will operate in these areas by majority decision 
this is the type of mechanism we are continually subjected to when playing the game of european integration with the brussels institutions 
the french must be made aware not only that the purpose of all these operations is to eliminate their country as a responsible centre for decision making but that furthermore every means will be used to extract their consent 
if they yield they are lost 
for it is their very means of defence which are being eliminated one by one 
 
it is crucial for us that it should be possible for this intergovernmental conference to be concluded before the end of the year so that there are no remaining formalities such as the weighting of votes in the council of ministers and the composition of the commission and the european parliament which place obstacles in the way of the enlargement of the eu 
we were therefore also very satisfied with the decisions which were taken on this issue at the helsinki summit in december 
an unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delaying the enlargement process 
that is something we do not want to see and we have therefore voted against any such extension 
we nonetheless very much agree with our colleagues that there is a need for transparency in connection with the intergovernmental conference so that people are clear as to how the work is proceeding 
 
possible future member states ought to be involved in and have an influence upon the shaping of the eu of the future 
the elections to the european parliament in showed perfectly clearly that the people of europe do not fall in with the notion of an ever more federalist eu centred upon brussels 
with the convening of the forthcoming igc the process of european union is topical once again 
once again the discussion is going to be monopolised by the heads of state and government 
in other words fifteen people are going to have discussions and decide behind closed doors on the fate of more than million individuals 
in fact one only need look at the agenda of the igc the institutions enlargement and european defence 
the fact is that the prime concerns are the strengthening of executive power the development of closer relations with liberalism in the countries of eastern europe and the relaunch of the militarisation of europe particularly by increasing military budgets 
social europe used as a foil by the eu has simply been eliminated from the agenda 
all this does is to legitimise the development on the european scale of resistance movements anxious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise workers' main claims towards the highest common denominator 
this is why i am voting against the report 
i voted for the resolution to adopt an opinion is in favour of convening the igc 
i did so because it sums up the philosophy of the portuguese presidency which is supported by a broad majority in parliament of opening up the igc agenda beyond issues strictly related to redressing the balance of power between member states large and small as was originally stated when the helsinki council was convened 
unfortunately in the issues covered by the resolutions on future subjects for revisions to the treaty on european union nothing has so far been stated about the need to review article which deals with suspending a state in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the founding principles of the union as laid down in article 
as the present crisis involving austria has demonstrated the union has the right to protect itself 
nevertheless the legal mechanisms that exist in the treaty are weak difficult to apply politically and legally do not define the powers of the institutions and do not guarantee fair legal treatment for processes of major importance 
suspending a state is just such a process and is to be condemned 
i therefore think that this issue should be included as a matter of urgency in the igc agenda and in itself this justifies a thorough revision of the treaties 
we feel that at present the central issues about convening an intergovernmental conference to amend the treaties are far more important than the controversy taking place here about the size of the agenda 
we have doubts concerning the appropriateness of the igc because we fear that the objectives actually being addressed may be far removed from the changes required to allow for the enlargement envisaged 
this relates in particular to the intended agenda particularly as regards the amsterdam leftovers which suggests that unacceptable inner cabinets will be created in the future 
this also identifies areas relating to the second and third pillars which tend to be reflected in an undesirable militarisation of the european union 
these are some of the basic reasons why we do not agree with the aims of the motion for a resolution now before us 
the european parliamentary labour party has abstained on the final vote on the leinen dimitrakopoulos report 
there is currently a great deal of work under way in terms of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthening of the eu institutions 
expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de-stabilisation 
the key factor in this text as it has been amended is the call for a charter of fundamental rights to be incorporated into the treaties 
in our view this would bring with it a complex legislative burden and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explains to citizens what their existing rights are 
beyond this we have concerns that the flexibility or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present 
the provisions of amsterdam are largely untested and allowing more scope for opt-outs could weaken the eu at the time when enlargement is being considered and applicant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other european legislation 
the european parliament and its committee on constitutional affairs ought instead to have been more specific and concentrated on just a few points in addition to the council decision in helsinki so stating what it considered to be the most pressing matters for discussion including the question of establishing a public prosecutor to deal with crimes against the institutions of the european union and their financial interests 
we swedish christian democrats also oppose any threats which have been made to delay the enlargement of the eu to the east if the agenda for the intergovernmental conference is not extended very considerably to include subjects in addition to those left over from the intergovernmental conference in amsterdam in 
the most important task of the forthcoming intergovernmental conference is to reform the eu before the accession of the new member states 
i nonetheless consider that the agenda for the intergovernmental conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for the enlargement to take place 
i also refer to my explanation of vote of november which clarifies my attitude towards supranationalism and common defence 
what we find most shocking is the fact that this joint intervention claims the authority of the treaty as if this stated somewhere that henceforth the free and democratic expression of a people could be cancelled by the will of the heads of government of neighbouring countries who in fact in this instance have carefully refrained from consulting their own peoples 
in our opinion it is clear that the left wing in the european parliament in association with the austrian left wing which was defeated in the electoral arena have mounted a petty political campaign resorting to the memory of a sinister but fortunately bygone period 
but going beyond this petty political operation what the majority in the european parliament is afraid of most of all is that the threat to the left-right cohabitation in austria which caused political life to stagnate and rot may soon spread to the european system of co-management which is producing equally appalling results 
in order to prevent this threat to the system it is ready to do anything including overruling the outcome of free elections including setting up a thought police including establishing a new form of totalitarianism 
madam president on behalf of the members of parliament who represent the front national the vlaams blok and the movimento sociale italiano i should like to ask the question in this outrageous interference in internal austrian affairs which the european union has undertaken in contravention of general international law in contravention of the treaties in contravention of morality who is pulling the strings 
is this hysteria spontaneous 
is it the product of mere foolishness or more probably of a deliberate strategy which is the same throughout the world 
who is imposing their will on the nations of europe daring to stop them choosing their own fate 
underground networks 
the government of the united states or of israel 
or their socialist back-up troops who in this house have the cheek to thrust their values down our throats 
what then are the values of these socialists who feathered their electoral nest in the last century by painting the idea of greater social justice in glowing colours for the benefit of the underprivileged and who today are nothing more than the party of protected civil servants full-time union officials and state capitalism 
what are the values of the belgian socialist party which only goes from paedophilia scandals to corruption scandals via vandam and agusta 
what are the values of the french socialist party which extorted money from all the town councils under its thumb in the urba sages and graco scandals 
i shall not even mention the instances of corruption in the italian socialist party because it does not do to kick a man when he is down still less when he is dead and gone 
i shall however mention the spanish socialist party which has just formed an alliance with the butchers of albacete and which settled its accounts with basque nationalists by hiring contract killers 
i shall also mention the german socialist party which dares to preach to us about the second world war when it is international socialist in the way that its peers were national socialists still goose-stepping the party of the waffen ss 
madam president i had a major problem with this resolution 
finally i abstained on the vote for a number of reasons 
i was in sympathy with the edd group amendment talking about rejecting the interference of the eu in the formation of governments of members states but i had to abstain because it just followed on the condemnation of xenophobia racism etc and i felt that it might be misinterpreted 
however i do wonder about the wisdom of this 
firstly there is the question of trying to combat intolerance with intolerance and the long-term consequences of that 
i also wonder about the wisdom of the eu and its reaction to the formation of the government in austria and how that is going to affect public opinion there 
at the moment it seems that the haider party is getting more support rather than less from the opposition by outside governments 
even america has now said that it is considering breaking off diplomatic relations 
we wonder if this is actually feeding the flames of xenophobia and the parties and people that support it 
i really think that people should be extremely cautious 
if you want to combat xenophobia and racism and i believe that we should we need to look at the root causes 
we need to look at the people who vote for these parties and understand why this situation arises 
it is not a situation that most people in this parliament want but we need to be careful about the approach we take so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we are trying to achieve 
madam president i strongly refute any statement demonstration or feeling of xenophobia or racism 
i disagree however for this very reason with the senseless actions taken by the presidency the portuguese presidency unfortunately which have resulted in a real institutional blunder on behalf of the other fourteen states 
this is not the way to fight extremism 
it may even be a way of doing extremism a great deal of good 
the torrent of confusion and rash actions that has been unleashed over austria has blown things out of all proportion 
it has caused considerable distress to decent citizens and evokes risks that had previously not even been considered 
there is an irreconcilable contradiction between positions adopted in the name of human rights and the rule of law but which at the same time attack the fundamental rights of the austrians and ride roughshod over the basic tenets of the rule of law in this case the standards laid down in the treaties 
what are we actually seeking to achieve in embarking on an intergovernmental conference 
a europe of states or a europe of or even fewer 
we support europe a europe which does honour to all the actions that have brought us to this point a europe which respects the treaties and the law and a europe which needs austria 
this needs to be said 
mr haider has demonstrated over the past years by both words and deeds that he deserves to be excluded from normal democratic discourse 
not only has he admired adolf hitler praised the waffen ss and refused to condemn a terrorist bombing that killed four roma but also in carinthia has been a member of the regional government 
some have said it is not right for us to interfere in austrian politics 
they are wrong 
european union treaties make it incumbent on us to protect fundamental rights 
some have said we have to accept the results of democratic elections 
however democratic elections do not make democrats of those who have threatened democracy 
there is the tragic monument of the holocaust the death of million jews to those who argued the same case with respect to germany in the 
however we should not condemn mr haider for ambition 
leopards do not change their spots 
we warn that this coalition if it is formed today unacceptably legitimises the extreme right directly in contradiction with the principles of peace and reconciliation which bring us together in this european union 
these are the values which we ask of others who seek to join us 
this european parliament requires the european commission to be vigilant of any racist action in austria and threatens to suspend austria from membership of the european union if this happens 
i am proud to support such a resolution 
though our proposal to withdraw political invitations to any austrian government representative to this european parliament has not carried today i give notice that we will further this proposal to ensure that any action within the powers of this european parliament to combat the return of neo-nazis to government in europe can and will be taken 
i shall take the floor very briefly madam president 
the document is unfair both to austrian members of the european parliament and to members of the austrian national parliament and it smacks slightly of jealousy and political interests but also of business 
i do not believe that these signals will change the citizens' indifference to europe 
the austrian extreme right has been gifted an unwarranted present 
i very much welcome the position taken by the italian radicals and i say this while making a clear historic and material distinction between italian liberals and austrian liberals 
i have for many years in word and deed been committed to the anti-fascist struggle and the struggles for equal rights and against xenophobia 
i have not been able to vote in favour of the present decision even though i agree with many of its premises 
what we have here first and foremost is an incredibly ominous mixture of power arrogance and impotence on the part of the european union 
not only do these decisions conflict with the treaty and apportion to the institutions of the union more power than that to which they are entitled but worst of all their effect will be counter-productive 
they will not weaken mr haider and the fpö 
on the contrary they will strengthen them 
we shall obtain the very opposite of what we want 
that is not how you combat racism and a swing to the right 
 
the european union bears a large measure of responsibility and along with it the two dominant political movements the social democrats and the christian democrats because by their dogmatic adherence to the harsh financial policies of emu their dislocation of the welfare state and their deification of uncontrolled competition they have pushed broad strata of society to the limits and made it possible for right-wing extremists of the haider type to recruit support for their neo-nazi ways 
we did so even though we did not agree with some of its recitals or terms in order to show our solidarity with all those in austria itself who are opposing the austrian extreme right and its demagoguery 
our vote in no way constitutes an endorsement of the signatories to this compromise resolution their present policy or their future attitude should the threat of the extreme right become more serious 
some of these parties despite declaring themselves to be republican and democratic adopt the demagoguery of the extreme right either out of connivance or as a vote-winning ploy if only in openly and hypocritically blaming the immigrant workers in our countries for unemployment and generally making their lives more difficult 
more generally those signatories who take part in or have taken part in government in the various states of the european union must take their share of responsibility in the influence which the extreme right has managed to gain since their policy devoted exclusively to the interests of big business has not included taking action likely to eradicate unemployment and the poverty it engenders and has thus facilitated the xenophobic demagoguery of the extreme right 
this week we heard the first political cry of the new-born europe 
it is a part of its future which is at stake right now part of its very essence its heart and soul 
the european parliament was the first to speak up 
the appeal by the european socialists on the initiative of olivier duhamel raised awareness and enabled there to be a firm and immediate political response to this unheard of and intolerable situation 
a firm attitude which the european states have demonstrated unanimously and promptly through mr guterres by condemning the risk of the austrian political situation getting out of control 
this courageous stance turns a new page in the construction of europe 
a return to the roots at last for a community built on the basis of the determination to turn our backs on a past history marred by hatred and exclusion and of adherence to the humanist values of openness and tolerance 
europe has managed to stand up to condemn unacceptable events 
however as it lacks the legal instruments to support this political will since the sanctions stipulated under article of the treaties are virtually impossible to apply will it be able to keep its head high in the face of the threat of the systematic blocking of its entire institutional structure 
the whole credibility of europe is at stake today before we invite the recent and still vulnerable democracies of the former eastern bloc to join us tomorrow 
from now on europe must put its words into action if it wishes to show the world the scope of its rediscovered ambition 
at this time when we are voting on a joint resolution against the inclusion of neo-nazis in the government of a european union member state i must express my regrets regarding a compromise text which is particularly lacking in backbone 
i am voting in favour of it because it is inconceivable that the european parliament after its excellent political debate yesterday should not adopt a stance on this matter 
personally however i shall continue to fight against the extreme right to urge people to sign a petition to demand measures which may go as far as the exclusion of austria and to organise a major public demonstration in lille on saturday at p.m 
fascism and neo-nazism are cancers 
the foul monster has been reawakened 
for me there is no question of allowing them to develop and to flourish without fighting with all our might 
europe was born out of a desire for peace freedom and tolerance 
there is no question of it allowing xenophobic racist and anti-semitic ministers to be tolerated at within it 
do not count on me to keep quiet without doing or saying anything 
such a concern is misplaced 
the european parliament has never been slow to comment on developments in member states with which they disagree 
we have condemned basque and irish terrorism 
we have opposed racism and the infringement of the rights of minorities 
it is our responsibility as a parliament particularly as the democratically elected voice of the european union to comment on current political developments in austria which are in conflict with the policies of this parliament 
by commenting and making our views known we are not preventing any party in austria from forming a coalition government 
we are nonetheless as is our right as well as our responsibility telling them that if they go ahead then there are consequences arising from such a decision and in fact we are warning them beforehand 
others would argue that we should suspend judgement until we see the detail of such an agreement 
such a view is not only a political cop-out it is positively dangerous 
in reaching an agreement with jörg haider and his party the austrian christian democrats would at a stroke be confirming political respectability on right wing extremism and also giving them access to power both of which they will utilise as a launching pad for even greater electoral success 
that is why the european union must make its position clear regarding the current situation in austria 
we have also voted in favour of the resolution in protest against the detestable politics that jörg haider stands for 
we are nonetheless very critical of the methods which the member states have employed on this issue 
the resolution makes no clear reference to respect for the member states' national identities and constitutional traditions in accordance with article of the treaty 
today as previously in the history of europe right-wing extremism is the result of insecure social and economic conditions of life 
the policy of cut-backs which has followed in the wake of adjusting to emu has promoted the successes of right-wing extremism 
a radical policy to promote security and justice in each country is the best guarantee of democratic development in europe 
it is intolerable that the eu should involve itself in the formation of the government in a member state 
it has no right to do so 
instead of prematurely condemning the fpö and the austrian government which is being formed there should first be a critical examination and assessment of the governmental declaration and the party programme and policies of the coalition 
only after such critical appraisal of the future policies of the parties involved in the coalition discussions can a decision be made as to whether this government is contrary to the democratic spirit of europe 
this does not mean that we sympathise with haider 
the csu european delegates have no sympathy whatsoever with the leader of the fpö 
however as politicians we must ask the question why % of the austrian population voted for a party such as the fpö at the elections in october 
we must concern ourselves with the reasons for this and try to deal with the reasons behind such results 
only by tackling the arguments and policies of the fpö can we prevent a radicalisation of austrian politics 
however the resolution of the european parliament does not question the reasons for the outcome of the austrian vote and offers no options for resolving the problem 
for these reasons the csu european delegates are against this resolution 
we are extremely concerned to witness this upsurge in the forces of the far right in europe especially in austria germany france belgium and italy 
it is crucial that we should discuss the underlying causes of this and that we should adopt measures to combat them 
an increase in social inequality unemployment and the problems of poverty and social exclusion creates suspicion amongst the general public and conditions which favour far-right populism 
in view of this it is vital that the european institutions should adopt the measures necessary to prevent the rise of racist and xenophobic ideologies 
this requires a sea change in the socio-economic policies of neo-liberal capitalism and that priority be given to creating quality jobs which give rights to employees 
this also requires policies which strengthen participatory democracy and which educate the general public particularly about the values of democracy and solidarity 
just as we condemn and repudiate the ideas and actions of the far right we also wish to express our solidarity with the austrian people 
we support all forces fighting for greater democracy and against racism and xenophobia 
he knew what those jubilant crowds did not know but could have learned from books that the plague bacillus never dies or disappears for good that it can lie dormant for years and years in furniture and linen-chests that it bides its time in bedrooms cellars trunks and bookshelves and that perhaps the day would come when for the bane and the enlightening of men it would rouse up its rats again and send them forth to die in a happy city 
it is with these phrases that albert camus at the close of the long allegorical novel describing the difficult fight of the citizens of the town of oran against the plague reminds us at the close of the second world war that the fight against nazism the brown plague as it was termed at the time could not enjoy a definitive victory 
that because racial hatred xenophobic violence fear and rejection of what is different have deep roots in all that is basest in humanity they may re-emerge at any moment and take over any group of human beings 
in this light the events we are seeing in austria must be seen as tragic 
for the first time since the second world war a party which is openly pro-nazi racist and xenophobic has gained access to power in a european country 
confronted with this threat which carries with it the negation of the very idea which lies at the heart of the construction of europe nothing must deter us not the legal quibbling about what the treaty does or does not permit not the legitimate questions about the right to intervene not the derisory respect for formal democracy and above all not the feeling of powerlessness which grips us in the face of an event which we reject with all the force of our convictions but which we are powerless to control 
as the representative for a french overseas department the island of réunion a land of racial and ethnic intermixing where the population has been forged in the course of the last three centuries by the successive contributions of europeans blacks from africa or madagascar enlisted men from india or pakistan or even chinese every day i experience the profound truth of the remark by saint-exupéry in being different to me you are not doing me harm brother but enriching me 
this human diversity is our main sources of wealth and this is the reason why it is my duty to track down and to condemn anything which may be harmful to it wherever it may exist 
for all these reasons i voted most decidedly in favour of the resolution before this house on the formation of the government in austria 
the success of the austrian freedom party owes as much to the endorsement of respectability provided by the austrian right wing and social democrats as to the policy of the latter whose social disasters paved the way for extreme right-wing populism 
the resolution stipulates possible diplomatic means to isolate the new government politically without even mentioning the root causes of the resurgence of fascism 
it can be explained by the feeling of helplessness of the people who are the victims of the ideology of mighty mammon and by the choice of the ruling classes to promote strong government in order to take their policies of austerity and deregulation ever further 
in order to oppose the xenophobic statements of an apprentice dictator who is nostalgic for the third reich we must take every opportunity we can to express our solidarity with the austrians opposed to fascism 
of course i in no way agree with the publicised statements of this right-wing populist and fully condemn xenophobia and any downplaying of the hitler regime 
however i fear that a purely emotional reaction by europe to the events in austria will only multiply haider's adherents 
the eu must not do him an invaluable pr service 
the strength of the fpö can be traced back to the weakness of the previous government and in this the austrian socialists must bear the main responsibility 
it was only after they unsuccessfully solicited the fpö to tolerate a minority government and obviously in vain offered the freedom party ministerial posts that the spö begin its massive campaign against haider 
it turned its threatened loss of power into an heroic battle for the preservation of values and an imminent pure-and-simple decision between democracy and non-democracy 
this is a smear on the voters in my neighbouring country which i cannot condone 
we german christian democrats used another strategy in the battle against extremists and clearly disassociated ourselves from them 
we revealed the hollowness of the republicans who were nationalistic xenophobic and anti-minority 
today the republicans are no longer represented in most local parliaments 
the german approach is no guarantee that this radical movement will not grow again 
it cannot be copied arbitrarily since each member state has its own specific conditions 
it can only succeed if agreements are made which are solidly based on compliance with democratic principles 
the council has become prematurely involved without waiting for the results of the coalition negotiations or a programme of government 
this condemnation is as unacceptable as the threatened breaking off of official contacts with the austrian republic 
sound democracy means being alert and not blind in one eye 
we must take up a reasoned offensive against radicals on both the right and the left 
i would have liked to see the same outrage in europe when the socialists were prepared to make common cause with the successors to the misanthropic and persecutory regime in the ddr 
in the meantime they have been forming governments in german federal states 
i fully support the statements made by commissioner prodi in today's session 
he spoke of the task of not isolating member states but of doing everything to unite them in common european values 
austria is a free independent and sovereign country 
consequently neither the council the commission nor the european parliament has the right to interfere in the internal administration of a member state 
the austrian elections were held in a free proper and democratic manner 
nevertheless these same institutions showed no reluctance to accept turkey as a candidate for membership of the european union despite its well-known human rights violations 
nothing of this nature has yet occurred in austria 
this precedent created on the initiative of the portuguese presidency is a worrying one as far as the future of the european union is concerned 
on the one hand the political excommunication of austria only demonstrates the worrying influence of conformist thought 
on the other hand if tomorrow the governments of european union member states must first receive not the confidence of the nation but the endorsement of supranational bodies then the very principle of democracy will be destroyed 
in such circumstances will it even be worth having elections 
this is not the way to create the conditions for the nations of europe to live together in harmony and to be able to cooperate to achieve a shared future 
first of all because the separate votes that we requested have not been adopted 
nor have certain amendments which taken together would make the text more consistent and meaningful 
secondly because the resolution that has just been adopted is self-contradictory on the one hand in recital d it recognises that the eu and its institutions' insistence on promoting and defending european democratic values implies that it recognises the integrity of the democratic rights and constitutional prerogatives of the austrian state and people 
on the other hand it takes the liberty of agreeing and even congratulating itself in paragraph on the political intent of the statement by the portuguese presidency 
to our mind this was nothing more than a hurried ill-considered and illegal interference in the result of the free exercise by the austrian state and people of their democratic rights and of their constitutional prerogatives 
at least they should not be prejudged which is what is happening here 
in fact this resolution and all similar statements do not show the slightest consideration for the will expressed by the electorate of a member state of the european union 
in addition to this we are opposing in the name of tolerance funnily enough the formation of the government which this result makes possible 
nor are we allowing it to prove the intentions and political ideas that it has repeatedly stated in the face of the accusations to which it is being subjected 
this resolution still allows the positions of those we seek to condemn to be strengthened as a result of this manipulation and victimisation and i regard this as foolish 
ultimately this sets a very dangerous precedent within the eu itself which can only lead to further undermining the climate of confidence and mutual respect that must exist between nations and citizens who want to pursue a common path in a spirit of equality and respect for national sovereignty 
this even applies to those who like us are poles apart from the racist and xenophobic views which seem to be spreading across europe but who prefer to oppose them by decisively attacking their root causes 
i believe there are circumstances when the question of principles and institutional regulations is obliterated 
i urge the council and the council presidency to continue to protect the fundamental values of the union 
i urge the commission to be less cautious 
in this resolution parliament is assuming its responsibilities 
having said that in my opinion the resolution adopted today is the absolute minimum the very least we could do 
personally i argued in favour of a rather harder line and i supported amendments nos and as well as the oral amendment tabled by the socialist group 
in fact i consider it essential for the council to accept only purely technical relations with the representatives of an austrian government which includes members of the austrian freedom party 
it is our fundamental values which are at stake here 
as the democratically elected representatives of the european people we have no choice 
we must reject what is unacceptable as our constituents demand 
because when the spectre of barbarism resurfaces failure to oppose is tantamount to capitulation 
i abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution 
however i cannot accept that an eu body should intervene politically in the internal policy of one member state 
i cannot therefore accept paragraph in the joint resolution and i cannot vote in favour of the resolution even though it would be a vote against the extreme right 
the political leaders of europe are entitled to express their view of political developments in another member state just as a prime minister can express his opinion about racist politicians in a local authority 
i therefore voted against paragraph of the resolution which presupposes that all parties have respect for human rights 
the treaties do not authorise this reaction by the member states 
nor should we isolate the forces in austria which wish to work for human rights 
that concludes the vote 
i declare the session of the european parliament adjourned 
i declare resumed the session of the european parliament adjourned on thursday february 
the minutes of the sitting on thursday february have been distributed 
are there any comments 
i can see from your reaction that many of the members of parliament have not received the minutes and clearly you cannot approve minutes which you have not seen 
i therefore propose to submit the minutes for your approval tomorrow morning since obviously you do not have them and i must apologise for this 
i shall therefore postpone the approval of the minutes 
madam president on a point of order 
the bbc this morning reported that a british member of this house holding a senior position within his delegation continues to offer strategic advice to private clients but does not state in the register of interests who these clients are 
the people of europe have a right to expect their representatives to keep the public interest separate from private profit but they can only be sure that this is being done in all cases if the information is both publicly available and easily accessible 
madam president since these matters are currently being considered by the quaestors may i ask you to use your influence both to ensure that the register of interests is brought up to date and modified to cover instances of this kind and above all to ensure that the register is not only available for inspection by this house but is also published on the internet 
thank you mr davies 
i shall look into this matter with the college of quaestors 
madam president on a point of order 
i would urge members to sign up to the commitment made today at the winning hearts conference that every child born in the new millennium has the right to live until the age of at least without suffering from avoidable cardiovascular disease 
madam president i rise under rule of the rules of procedure of this house and allude to the same point raised by mr davies about the very serious allegations made on bbc radio this morning 
i would welcome an assurance from you that you will order an investigation to ensure that the two members who were named in this particular bbc interview are not running their companies from this parliament or from parliamentary offices because that would be a very serious matter indeed 
thank you mr murphy 
as i informed mr davies i promise to look into this matter this very evening with the quaestors 
madam president on a point of order 
i have already written to you on a number of occasions concerning how points of order are raised in the house 
i wonder on what point of order mr davies was speaking 
why did he not mention the fact that one of his own liberal colleagues also has a consultancy that is under investigation by the bbc 
is this house going to let its agenda be determined by scurrilous reports on a programme which bases its news items on lies or is it going to get down to serious work and address the challenges facing europe 
gentlemen obviously the quaestors who look into this matter are not going to be basing their assessment just on information from radio programmes 
they will look into the matter thoroughly 
madam president i believe i am expressing the feeling of a great number of members of parliament in most of the political groups when i say that the message which the president of the commission sent to the new austrian chancellor a week ago created some unease 
was it in fact necessary in this message to specifically offer his best wishes for success or to say i am sure that you will demonstrate the same commitment as shown by your predecessors to liberty democracy respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms or indeed that he awaited productive and constructive cooperation 
this is why madam president i should like to see mr prodi clarify tomorrow exactly what significance he meant to give these words so that nobody absolutely nobody can use this message which is unusual and unwise to say the least to contribute and that includes counter to the intentions of mr prodi towards making the dangerous political operation taking place in austria a commonplace 
thank you mr wurtz 
i would ask you ladies and gentlemen not to start a debate at this point 
this was just a procedural motion 
let me remind you mr wurtz that we shall be seeing mr prodi tomorrow 
naturally you will be perfectly free to ask him questions in the speeches you make following this statement just as mr prodi will be perfectly free to answer you 
i suggest that you clarify this matter at that time if you so wish and if mr prodi agrees 
madam president it is with great regret that i have to trouble you yet again with an issue that i have raised here twice before 
i have already told you on a number of occasions that we on behalf of the dutch contingency would like a dutch television channel 
there are now channels here in this parliament including two greek one portuguese one finnish and one belgian but still no dutch and as many as seven english six german and six french 
i was promised back in september that there would be a dutch channel by january 
it is now february and we are still waiting 
i would ask you once again to work on this 
i wonder what kind of mediaeval bureaucracy is at work here preventing a dutch channel from being transmitted by satellite 
mrs plooij-van gorsel let me say how disappointed i am because i personally thought this problem had been resolved long ago 
i have clearly received your series of messages on this subject and i believe that mrs banotti has an answer for you 
i shall therefore with your permission give the floor to mrs banotti to reply to you under the procedural motion 
madam president as my dear friend elly will know i will do anything to make her and my dutch colleagues happy 
i would like to assure you as quaestor in charge of this issue that we have had technical discussions about the various channels on television and radio and i have already started mailing colleagues in this connection 
if it is of any comfort to her the irish have not got their channel yet either 
there seem to be intractable technical problems but we are definitely working on it 
thank you for giving me the opportunity to clarify this 
i am not so sure that our dutch members will be reassured on the grounds that the irish members too are unable to receive a national channel 
i think we must do what we can to see that all members can receive their own national channel 
thank you mrs banotti and also the other quaestors for your effort to achieve this 
austria therefore is perfectly entitled to form its government and the president of the commission is perfectly entitled and even duty bound to offer austria his best wishes 
mr wurtz should perhaps remember that not so long ago other members of his party the french communist mayors were sending bulldozers against immigrant hostels in france 
the next item is the final version of the draft agenda as drawn up by the conference of presidents pursuant to rule of the rules of procedure 
president 
is there anyone who wishes to speak on behalf of these groups in favour of this proposal 
since no one wishes to speak i shall put this proposal to the vote 
president 
i have received several proposed amendments relating to the topical and urgent subjects of major importance 
according to the list given in the final version of the agenda there are already four items 
we can therefore table only one additional item 
who wishes to speak on behalf of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party to propose the addition of an item on cambodia 
madam president it is hugely important to the liberal group that we talk about the situation in cambodia and that this is done at this particular time not only on account of the letter which un secretary-general kofi annan has written to the government in cambodia asking it to take steps at long last to set up a special tribunal in order to call the leaders of the khmer rouge to account but also because the hun sen regime obviously not content with the attempted assassinations of the leader of the opposition mr sam raninsy has now considered that his parliamentary immunity should be lifted to boot so that he can simply be brought before the court 
the international community has asked for justification for what is happening in cambodia 
after all we approved the elections in cambodia in what was one of the biggest fiascos on the electoral observation front 
only this parliament has emerged with some of its credit intact 
i think that we as a parliament even now have to assume our responsibility and speak out on the situation in cambodia 
this renders the proposed item on pinochet null and void 
in addition i have received some proposals for subjects to be included in the topical and urgent debate 
in view of the time available given that as you know we have a commission statement on the restructuring of business and that the current list already includes two items we can only add two additional items 
president 
we will now take the proposal from the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party 
is there anyone to speak in favour of this proposal 
madam president it is remarkable that the european parliament has not yet adopted a position on the possible release of mr pinochet despite the fact that international arrest warrants have already been issued 
it is inconceivable that the european parliament which quite rightly pays so much attention to respecting human rights should fail to adopt a clear stance on this 
madam president this matter is far too serious to be dealt with by means of an urgent procedure at this time 
firstly the european parliament has already expressed its opinion on the subject of general pinochet but furthermore there are certain questions to be borne in mind 
the first is that this matter is sub judice in several european countries and i would like to remind members that there is still no european judicial area nor a european legal system 
we are in favour of the international criminal court but it does not yet exist 
secondly there is currently a democratically elected government in chile led by ricardo núñez whose first declaration was that all those who have committed this type of crime must face justice and i would remind you that the chilean justice system which is independent is currently examining complaints lodged against general pinochet concerning his crimes against humanity 
i believe that this is a serious issue which we are obliged to follow up but it should not be dealt with by means of urgent procedure 
we believe that justice should be done in this case but this is not the most appropriate procedure 
is there a member who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal 
madam president ladies and gentlemen what has occurred in a tributary of the danube is considered by many experts to be an accident on an environmental scale as serious as the scale of the chernobyl disaster 
it affects not only romania but also yugoslavia and in fact the entire danube basin 
we consider the matter to be important enough for the commission to react swiftly to this situation and i think that parliament must make its position clear and vote on a resolution on the subject 
is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of the ppe in favour of this proposal 
madam president the agenda has been rearranged so many times that i would simply ask the chamber to support the present proposal 
it is not a very time-consuming matter but it is extremely important that it should get through parliament now and that there should be no delays 
it is in fact about protecting the euro against counterfeiting which is an extremely urgent matter 
we have tried to drive this proposal through 
i should therefore be very grateful indeed if the chamber could support it 
relating to friday president 
relating to friday on friday morning we have an oral question on postal services and the group of the party of european socialists is requesting that the motions for resolutions should be put to the vote immediately after the debate and not in brussels as envisaged in the final version of the draft agenda 
is there a member who wishes to speak on behalf of the pse group in favour of this proposal 
madam president with apologies to my friend enrique barón crespo i should like to speak against this proposal 
i am surprised it has even been made because we came to an agreement following an exchange in the conference of presidents 
i think that your proposal madam president to keep the debate and the vote separate with the debate on friday and the vote at a later date is a reasonable one 
the reason is as follows this issue concerns no less than employees within the european union 
we already have a directive 
it is not an old one it was issued in 
deciding upon future policy lines with a view to a new directive rather hastily without having had time to consult the trade unions or have discussions with all the social partners i feel runs counter to the spirit we wish to inject into the debate on matters which directly involve the social operators 
i propose therefore that we should keep the arrangements as per the agenda with the debate on friday and the vote at a later date 
madam president i clearly owe mr wurtz an explanation and i am going give this explanation before the whole house 
we had reached this agreement on principle in the conference of presidents 
at the time i did not know that commissioner bolkestein was going to appear next week before the committee on regional policy transport and tourism to discuss this matter 
madam president i should simply like to ask mr wurtz to take a second look at what this is about 
it has nothing to do with any disputes on the substance it is just about the following question when will the commission having already had a year and a half to do this finally be in a position to table the directive 
our sole intention in tabling the motion is to ensure that the deadlines which were promised are now finally adhered to and it is therefore important that we act as quickly as possible 
that is why i should like to support the social democrats' request to hold the vote on friday 
that ought to mean that we have more time on thursday 
since we will be very pressed for time in the topical and urgent debate in view of the many matters to be addressed in an hour and a half i simply wanted to ask whether the sessional services might not check to see whether we could have an extra half an hour for the topical and urgent debate so that there is sufficient speaking time 
in general the way in which sittings have been managed in recent weeks seems to me to have been very chaotic 
last thursday speaking times were extremely tight and then suddenly we had between one and one-and-a-half hours when there was nothing on the agenda and we had to wait for the vote 
on friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda 
that is absolutely absurd 
i really should like to ask that a review be carried out of the way in which sittings are managed 
this sounds perfectly feasible 
this is all i am talking about here just that 
madam president i would like to talk about an item on the agenda for wednesday which you have not yet announced 
i understand that there is no argument about the fact that the council declaration on the next sitting of the united nations commission on human rights is not going to include the declaration on the anniversary of the geneva conventions and that this declaration has been proposed for the plenary part-session in march so that it may be delivered in a solemn and formal way 
i understand that there is agreement on this issue 
madam president this afternoon in this chamber reference was made to a series of reports on the bbc today programme this morning which claimed that certain of my colleagues were running personal lobbying companies or somehow misusing their position as members of this house 
these are serious allegations 
they are completely untrue malicious politically biased and were broadcast in the full knowledge of their falsehood 
we are taking legal advice 
my colleagues' register of interests is complete 
if we find that any member of this house or their employees collaborated with the bbc in this farrago we will expose them to the opprobrium of this house 
quite we agree absolutely 
 
upon referral to committee we examined over a hundred amendments and so far amendments some of which have already been presented in committee have once again been tabled 
before discussing the content of the resolution i should like to inform you of the elements which i took account of and which guided my work as rapporteur 
first of all i would like to remind you of the function of the interreg community initiative founded on the principle of transnationality and innovation 
this programme constitutes a driving force for development on the european scale 
interreg is one of the four community initiatives scheduled for the period and is the one with the largest budget for implementation i.e eur billion as opposed to eur billion at the present time 
at the time of the reform of the structural funds in and the interreg cip has incorporated new strands contributing to the development of trans-european transport and energy distribution networks 
these programmes promoted cross-border transnational and interregional cooperation within the european union by encouraging balanced development of the community area 
the interreg iii programme for which we have before us today the guidelines issued by the european commission pursuant to the terms of european community regulation no de laying down general provisions on the structural funds continues these measures 
it is based on three strands strand a organises cross-border cooperation between regional and local authorities in border regions at both internal and external borders of the european union on the basis of joint cross-border development strategies which member states' local and regional authorities are responsible for implementing strand b governs transnational cooperation between national regional and local authorities in various member states or applicant countries regarding regional development transport networks and the environment 
member states i.e national authorities are responsible for implementing this strand 
finally strand c organises interregional cooperation between different regions of the member states or third countries to exchange experience under strands a and b and cooperate in the fields of research and technological development subject to consultation with the european commission which is responsible for its implementation 
the new interreg programme in the form in which we have received it takes into consideration the needs engendered by enlargement to the countries of eastern and central europe and to island regions and most remote regions 
the commission proposes redistributing the interreg funding as follows between and % for strand a % for strand c and the remainder for strand b i.e from up to a maximum of % 
the european commission draws up the list of eligible regions for strand a and strand b it bases its assessment principally on the map of regions eligible during the previous programming period 
the most remote regions may benefit from support under strand b the commission draws up a list of priority areas and eligible measures which for strand a is not comprehensive but is comprehensive for strand b the commission reserves the option to at a later date put forward topics it considers important to the exchange of experience and strengthened cooperation between regions for strand c 
the adoption procedure for the programmes is established by the general regulations on structural funds 
proposals are drawn up by member states and are submitted for approval to the european commission which checks their conformity with the general guidelines adopted 
these proposals must include a number of elements an overview of the cross-border or transnational priorities and strategies a description of the measures necessary to their implementation and an indicative financial plan 
i belong to the great majority of members of parliament who voted in favour of continuing the interreg community initiative programme 
i regret that parliament was not informed about the appraisal of the previous programme which would have enabled the new measures implemented to reach optimum efficiency but i acknowledge that this was not an easy operation 
i also regret the fact that we had an extremely short period to work in as the text was examined in parliamentary committee on november last year and then on january 
i further regret the fact that neither the regions nor the representative regional organisations were involved in framing the programme 
in promoting cross-border transnational and interregional cooperation this cross-disciplinary instrument is the very incarnation of a regional policy on the european scale intended to encourage harmonious and balanced development of the community territory 
an integrated development policy for all rural areas in the european union is therefore needed consisting of the following elements an integrated multi-sectoral approach simplification of administrative procedures improvement of the partnership between european institutions and national and local actors and protection of the environment 
in its policy paper agenda the commission set out two key principles on which rural development policy should be based the recognition of the multifunctionality of agriculture and the need for an integrated strategy for developing rural areas 
the second principle is based on the fact that nowadays many of the job opportunities in rural areas are outside the traditional agricultural sector so that a complete development programme which integrates rural development policies with agricultural sector policies needs to be implemented 
in this way rural development is becoming a pillar of the cap 
the leader community initiative was launched in to promote a new bottom-up approach to rural development and to diversify measures by adapting them to local needs 
the following objectives were set improving the development potential of rural areas by calling upon local initiative promoting the acquisition of knowledge in the rural development sector disseminating this knowledge to other rural areas 
leader i applied to the rural areas covered by structural fund objectives and and local action groups participated in it with financing of eur million 
in october following the success of leader i and leader ii the commission decided to extend the initiative 
for the period provision has been made unfortunately only for a total contribution of eur million and an indicative allocation for each member state has been set 
it is also more ambitious and better geared to the challenges which rural areas will have to meet 
i therefore approve of the continuation of the initiative because as i was saying it emphasises the innovative development strategies and because it is more ambitious even though there is still the need to make the criteria by which areas qualify as rural more flexible so as not to penalise rural areas with high or low population densities 
i believe the networking system to be vital for the exchange of information and skills and for the implementation of joint projects between different areas of the union and i repeat that in order to be fully successful it must exploit inter alia measures already in existence such as the carrefours 
i regret the delay with which leader as was the case with the other three initiatives was presented to parliament and for the knock-on delay this entailed for the whole procedure 
finally i am concerned by the paucity of the amount allocated if you consider in addition that this time the programme is available to all the countries of the union and will be implemented for a year longer than the previous leader ii 
i would like to thank the commission services for their helpfulness and cooperation and i would like to thank my colleagues in the committee on agriculture for the contribution they have made through their amendments 
madam president ladies and gentlemen my report on equal takes the form of an opinion delivered as part of the process of consultation on a new community initiative whose objective is to promote transnational cooperation and through it new methods of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market 
this community initiative succeeds the two forerunner programmes adapt and employment and has a much smaller budget of around eur billion 
the initiative adopts a completely new approach which is to develop innovative employment models within transnational geographical or sectoral development partnerships 
the intention is clear targeted projects are to be developed at transnational level projects which are based on the employment policy guidelines of employability entrepreneurship adaptability and equal opportunities 
this objective is very much to be welcomed and also meets with a broad consensus in this house 
in addition equal should feed into the national action plans for employment and its implementation should be able to be monitored through these action plans 
it is an important community initiative which together with the three other initiatives urban leader and interreg is financed out of the structural funds 
in my report i have tried to reduce excessive administrative expenditure and to build greater openness and flexibility into the system of development partnerships 
nevertheless technical assistance is necessary 
particular attention is also paid to the dissemination of results and learning from each other by identifying best practice with special emphasis on mainstreaming 
i have endeavoured to secure the widest possible support for the report 
this has meant a reduction in the number of amendments from over in committee to for the plenary which has also created numerous opportunities for compromises 
a compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers 
however in this context madam president to allow us to work out the details i should like to request that the vote on the equal report be held not tomorrow but on wednesday 
i believe that it is important for the community initiative to be able to begin on time and therefore for the report to receive overwhelming support so that the commission is also obliged to take into consideration the constructive proposals made by the european parliament because parliament put the appropriations for equal in the reserve precisely so as to ensure that members' ideas were also reflected in this community initiative 
in this connection the european parliament is also justified in insisting that it should be possible to amend the thematic priorities only after a further hearing in parliament 
equal should live up to its name and this is my firm intention 
it should provide equal opportunities for all those at a disadvantage in the european union 
it should prevent society from splintering 
it should prevent exclusion from being part of everyday life 
everyone should be given the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regardless of their age gender or origin 
that is my intention and i would ask the house to give this report overwhelming support 
madam president it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new urban community initiative and it is an achievement that i am here tonight because air france cancelled my flight at p.m. but i am here 
just a year ago when the commission produced its proposals around agenda it axed the urban initiative 
yet we as politicians knew that there was a groundswell of support for continuing this initiative into the year 
parliament therefore can take credit for a successful lobbying campaign to put urban back on the agenda and get the commission and council to make a u-turn 
urban policy has always been at the forefront of eu policy 
in my member state for example we are developing a strategic approach in a white paper and an urban government taskforce is looking at the problems of urban communities 
with eight out of ten people in europe living in urban areas it is right that we help our most deprived communities to tackle the all too familiar problems of deprivation social exclusion joblessness crime drug dependency and all the problems that are associated with that 
for example in my own region in manchester the urban community initiative has been a tremendous success 
urban funds have been invested in one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the uk in moss side 
the millennium youth park project is helping to get young people re-engaged in regenerating their own community and in addition to support for small businesses and social policy we are beginning to see a turnaround of a very deprived urban community 
the work of this urban agenda was then taken out to the wider community with an active communication and publicity campaign in local supermarkets and famous british pubs 
this is the kind of good practice we would like to see extended across the eu in terms of communication and publicity 
as regards the specific guidelines governing the initiative they are broadly defined to give scope for local and regional diversity 
we agree that they ought to be indicative in nature allowing the maximum flexibility to ensure that we target specific programmes 
in committee we are not in favour of reducing the number to 
we are in favour of reduction overall but we believe that the arbitrary number of is not the key factor 
instead we should go for good-quality projects that can act as a catalyst to effect change and renewal to attract inward investment in terms of loans and venture capital and to achieve a multiplier effect 
the member states should therefore be able to propose a reasonable number of areas within the financial ceiling of their allocations 
in the designation of local urban programmes we need to make good use of local indicators and statistics on deprivation and health to enable us to more effectively target the most affected areas 
in the uk the local index of deprivation is a very good example of a widely used standard and statistic to help determine not only eu but national and regional assistance programmes 
this needs to be acknowledged as a tool and resource in addition to the eu criteria 
i would ask you to take on board local indicators to help us do that 
our most deprived urban neighbourhoods face a plethora of problems high unemployment and often very low-paid precarious employment poverty and social exclusion 
often these problems are compounded by poor health and housing stock and a culture of drug dependency 
we therefore have unstable communities which are infiltrated with crime drug-dealing and gangs 
this is all too familiar in many of our urban areas 
all these complex problems undermine the quality of life for our urban residents yet we have the potential in these areas to create growth and prosperity 
that is why again in my report i have asked that action under the urban programme should not merely provide a single solution to a single problem these areas do not have single mono problems 
instead communities in urban areas should be encouraged to present integrated action plans to tackle their specific urban problems using eu resources as a value added to local actions 
i would like to see those actions extended to cover health and anti-discrimination as provided for in the amsterdam treaty 
the community initiative means community involvement 
some of the most active and committed proponents and agents of change in our urban areas are local residents 
we need to encourage them to participate in designing and delivering projects for these programmes 
the time-scale therefore proposed by the commission is very ambitious 
it is better to have quality projects with the active participation of community groups than to have projects delivered on time but without local participation 
the commission must of course provide full disclosure and transparency concerning the selection criteria used for the new urban initiatives but it must also disclose the consultancy networks which are being used to deliver the exchange of good practice 
this is important in the interests of transparency and the overall effectiveness of networks 
finally i should like to emphasise that in order to address the problems facing the post-industrial city we require local participation 
we need to deploy the energies of the unemployed the underused skills of youth and the experience of age to tackle these problems 
we shall thereby be able to replace poverty dependency and alienation with equity initiative and participation 
this will help us to restore the credibility of the eu and the confidence of citizens that europe can deliver local action to solve local problems 
 
as we have heard the objective of urban is the promotion of innovative strategies to promote economic and social regeneration in urban areas bearing in mind that % of the population of europe lives in cities 
creating a functioning urban environment in terms of social policy requires a policy of long-term job creation action to combat poverty measures to assist low-income groups and old people facilities for children racial and ethnic integration better opportunities for participation a targeted public health policy including measures to prevent drug abuse and concerted crime prevention measures 
the communication from the commission takes account of the need to adopt approaches combining a range of economic social and infrastructural measures 
however we must remember that in addition to urban a number of other community instruments are also available in the social sector innovative actions under article of the esf regulation pilot projects particularly the new preparatory action for local commitment to employment that has just been introduced by the european parliament under the budget and the equal and interreg initiatives and mainstream esf activities 
as the committee on employment and social affairs stressed in its opinion the commission must therefore recognise the need to exploit synergies in this context while avoiding duplication of multiple funding 
while on the one hand we believe that steering committees should ensure that the various projects are coherent and complementary we would on the other hand urge the commission to reinforce exchanges of information and coordination between the departments involved 
not only is this coordination essential but as we stated in our opinion exchanges and the dissemination of expertise and good practice must also be essential 
that situation will be compounded by social reclassifications resulting from european union enlargement and we must therefore make provision for the economic regeneration and social cohesion of our cities 
addressing those problems is all the more urgent in view of the marked spread of cities into the surrounding areas and in view of the cities' historical and cultural role 
however in order for such an effort to succeed it is necessary to secure the commitment and participation of the public as a whole and to enlist the support of the less active social groups and the groups particularly affected by the economic and social crisis 
here we wish to stress the need for the balanced involvement of women and the agencies that represent them in planning and implementing the urban initiative programmes 
as the committee on equal opportunities we also stress the need to finance infrastructures that will facilitate professional activity by women mainly by harmonising their professional and family commitments and more generally infrastructures that promote solidarity between the generations social solidarity 
effective implementation of this initiative could have a cumulative result because it could inspire similar action at regional and local levels thus increasing its political importance still further since women need to feel the effects of european policy in their day-to-day life in real terms 
mr president our committee welcomed the priorities proposed by the commission for the urban programme of better integration of local communities and ethnic minorities and improved security and crime prevention 
in committee we thought that it was necessary for the economic and social regeneration of urban areas to go hand-in-hand with the creation of an atmosphere of tolerance towards minorities and therefore for measures designed to reduce racism and xenophobia to be an integral part of programmes to be funded by urban 
we considered that increasing public confidence by combating everyday urban crime was one of the central tasks of urban regeneration 
our committee noted that innovative and effective action to combat and prevent crime at local level would require a whole array of measures including the incorporation of crime prevention in town planning action to prevent juvenile delinquency the reintegration of offenders and models for effective local cooperation between the various parties involved for example the police the courts and social services 
we adopted our recommendation unanimously in the committee because we felt that it was particularly important to continue urban which in the past has been implemented successfully because as we see it programmes of this kind are the only way in which we in the european union will succeed in ensuring that in the long term all those who live in the european union enjoy peaceful coexistence 
for this reason we very much welcome programmes of this kind 
i should like to comment on the concerns which the committee on employment and social affairs has with regard to the largest of the four community initiatives interreg iii 
it must also be possible to a considerable extent for social measures to receive support under interreg iii 
in the light of the fact that % of unemployment in the union is essentially structural and given the particular sensitivity of the situation in the border regions i need only refer to the possibility of unwelcome migration this is not only reasonable but imperative 
the measures eligible for funding listed in annex ii of strand a do also seem encouraging in this respect 
in reality however the commission communication does not contain a single provision for the member states with these integrated approaches for social and employment policy aspects 
i should therefore like to draw your attention in particular to the inclusion of increased numbers of vocational training measures especially in areas with high levels of long-term and youth unemployment 
employment policy measures should also be eligible for funding under strand b especially for the applicant countries as part of the pre-accession strategy 
in general where the employment policy measures are concerned it would seem to me to be necessary for appointments to the joint cooperation committee to be made on a regional basis because the local expertise required for these specific purposes is only available at regional level so as to avoid these measures becoming too abstract and therefore proving disappointing 
however i should like to point out that it is precisely here that this is fatal 
it is precisely where employment policy is concerned that we should work towards measures which are as simplified as possible so that the social dimension of the eu is once again given the importance which it deserves 
we ask for a guarantee that the decision-making bodies for the projects are represented equally by three elements political representatives and public administrations companies and economic operators and social operators including unions and non-governmental organisations 
we would particularly like to stress that there must be balanced representation between men and women in all of these bodies 
we would also like to stress that the main objective is the promotion of strategies for sustainable development whose positive effects would extend to a broader geographical area than the local community itself and we therefore feel it is appropriate for the projects to be integrated into the development programmes included in objectives and and into the regional planning of the regions and countries in which they are located 
the committee believes that projects financed under action should place value on the potential of endogenous development in particular based on local traditions techniques and practices on specific production and on the management of sustainable energy 
the committee supports the commission proposal to concentrate actions in small selected areas and believes that given the dispersed nature of many rural inhabited locations the minimum demographic ceiling for the selection of a project should be reduced to inhabitants 
we believe it is necessary to coordinate the development objectives and management mechanisms of actions and financed by leader with those of other actions financed by other community programmes relating to interregional and international cooperation and partnership such as interreg sapar phare tacis and meda in the same areas 
 
we believe that it should have been incorporated in a special chapter of the treaty devoted to equal opportunity between women and men 
this would have been a logical consequence of the new central role given to equality between women and men in the treaty 
with regard to the equal proposals in the community initiative programmes there should be a clear distinction between priority actions aimed at combating gender discrimination and actions aimed at combating other kinds of discrimination 
a gender-mainstreaming approach must be adopted by member states and they therefore need to put the emphasis on projects that not only aim to promote the fight against gender discrimination but also facilitate reconciliation of work and family life 
some issues were more sensitive than others partnerships for example on which we need to reach a compromise in order to assert and support the commission proposal 
at the same time we nevertheless need to ask the commission for a certain amount of flexibility so that we can subsequently include other topics 
technical assistance and simplification must also be included among the fundamental points 
from a political point of view the most sensitive issue was asylum-seekers 
we would never have accepted parliament backing down this is our position from what the commission has already proposed and i am keen to stress this 
mr president mrs stenzel ladies and gentlemen before addressing the equal report itself i should like to make a point of principle in connection with the employment guidelines on which the report is based 
the basic objectives of an eu-wide employment policy are laid down in the guidelines and include employability entrepreneurship and adaptability 
these objectives are obviously intended to make employees as useful and usable as possible to the economy 
only then does it stop being a question of economic usability and start being about people having equal rights to shape their own lives 
all asylum seekers and refugees are to be included explicitly in the programmes although this should be self-evident 
nevertheless the conservatives voted against this in the committee 
i would ask them the following questions does your policy seek to marginalise people 
what is the idea behind preventing people from working when they wish to do so 
does this not stand in stark contradiction to the guideline on employability 
it is also worth mentioning that this is a mainstreaming programme because there remains a shortcoming in the report 
anyone who lets men happily climb the career ladder and worries only about childcare places without fighting against the way in which the work of reproduction is shared out unevenly has not and unfortunately that includes women understood the concept of mainstreaming 
mr president ladies and gentlemen the committee on regional policy transport and tourism adopted this opinion on the equal report at its concluding discussion with no votes against and one abstention 
i am deliberately stating this at the beginning of my intervention to make it clear that there is in fact an alternative view to that of the committee responsible the committee on employment and social affairs 
this cross-group support for the opinion is explained by the conclusions which are devoted to the question of how issues related to regional policy transport and tourism can be combined with action to combat all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market 
the members of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism of course also identify a number of areas of the commission proposal which they would criticise firstly for example the insufficient thematic guidelines laid down for the development partnership activities secondly the fact that strict selection criteria for evaluating the project proposals will only be drawn up only at a later stage by the commission and thirdly the fear of excessive administrative and technical expenditure on project management by the commission and the technical assistance bodies 
that is why a ceiling needs to be set for administrative expenditure 
the committee based its conclusions on these critical comments 
we attached particular importance to linking the creation of new jobs for disadvantaged and excluded people in the social sector in tourism and in small and medium-sized enterprises with promoting the establishment of new small and medium-sized businesses bearing in mind the necessary economic structural change 
dovetailing the activities under the community initiative with the european employment initiatives is an essential requirement and a crucial prerequisite for attaining the objectives of the equal programme 
we fully support the innovative approach towards setting up development partnerships and organising the exchange of experience at european level as an integral part of the equal programme 
the specific target of deriving european added value brings the regional cooperation up to european level while retaining the cooperation of the various regional operators 
this is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it 
mr president ladies and gentlemen it has already been mentioned today that the first urban initiative was an unqualified success 
the fact that this initiative will now be continued in the form of urban ii albeit with a smaller budget is something for which we have to thank individual committed members of this parliament including in particular as far as i have heard as a new member of this parliament the rapporteur mrs mccarthy whom i should therefore like to thank very much for her dedication and of course also for her report on urban ii 
a new feature of the urban ii initiative is that it has been tailored to small cities or parts of cities 
this is important because it is precisely small cities which often find it harder to access aid 
and yet the problems which give rise to the urgent need for regeneration can be particularly acute precisely in cities of this kind and thus have a proportionally adverse effect 
to increase the effectiveness of individual measures the number of projects for urban ii has been limited to 
i think that it is important not to stick rigidly to this arbitrary quantitative restriction and instead to leave it to the member states to decide between how many projects they each wish to divide the support funds to which they are entitled 
in any case it is necessary to ensure that in small member states in particular it is not only areas of large cities which are again in receipt of the support 
there urban ii would only be a drop in the ocean its success would be doubtful and the whole thing would be a flop 
just as important in my view is not to broaden the selection criteria for urban ii too much and thus water them down 
it is precisely a strictly defined list of criteria which is essential if the programmes which are funded are to be models and be transferable to other problem cities in the future 
from my own experience of local government in an old industrialised region beset with problems i should like in conclusion to ask for your particular support ladies and gentlemen for two points in the report which alongside the social policy aspects are i believe essential 
firstly environmental protection is essential for sustainable urban development and the inclusion of this aspect should therefore be a general requirement for a project to receive funding 
secondly preventing and combating routine urban crime and crime related to drug dealing must start at local level 
these are essential steps towards increasing the quality of urban life and must therefore also play a central role in the urban ii initiative 
mr president ladies and gentlemen i would like to thank the rapporteurs who have managed to produce excellent reports in just a short time 
however criticism has been voiced within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee 
the reports are late and in addition they were very hastily discussed by the committee on regional policy transport and tourism 
a good opportunity to discuss the results good practices and shortcomings of the earlier programmes was therefore lost 
our group is keen to stress the importance of cross-border activity under the interreg programme and especially cooperation focusing on areas outside the european union 
such important areas include the balkans and the adriatic region but in my opinion we should not ignore cooperation with russia either 
our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of funds and emphasise the importance of better coordination of the interreg tacis ispa and phare programmes 
this coordination is at present lacking and the commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it 
we here in parliament are waiting for the commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue as soon as possible 
it is of decisive importance to get local business organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes 
experience shows that projects of cooperation need better planning and closer monitoring and need to be generally more successful 
projects have often remained half-finished and their efficiency has been drained by administration and bureaucracy 
we also have to demand that our partners in cooperation be committed to projects and fulfil their share of the agreement 
our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee 
it will not work as an automatic target but must be applied in the target area according to prevailing conditions 
this is such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusions have to drawn 
mr president ladies and gentlemen interreg is one of the most european of all the structural funds 
here projects covering only one region or one country will not receive support they will have to cover neighbouring regions in two or more countries 
unfortunately this is only true for part of the money that is only for the borders within the eu 
but it is precisely the regions on borders with third countries which need an operational instrument to foster cross-border cooperation 
the regulation pretends that there is one but there is not 
the fact is that the commission has not amended the regulation for years although parliament has been calling for it to do so for some time 
the practical consequence for these regions in the immediate future is that support for border areas will again be downgraded 
since parliament has been calling for a joint fund to be created for cooperation with third countries in order to resolve difficulties 
nothing has happened 
the difficulties are once again being allowed to persist to the detriment of the regions concerned 
parliament is here renewing its call for an improvement and for cross-border cooperation and we look forward to a joint fund being created and to the regulation being amended once more in cooperation with the other commissioners 
we want a europe for the people and not a europe of paper-pushers 
mr president a third of eu money is invested in funds for all kinds of development causes 
according to my group this is excellent if as a result of this deprivation within regions towns and population groups is eliminated or if health and the environment improved 
that is a question of solidarity and progress 
but dishing out increasing amounts of money is no guarantee for improved spending 
the local councils and regions where the money ends up have since gained practical experience 
they find it is extremely difficult to spend the money on their most needy causes 
anything related to economic growth and infrastructure usually scores quite highly but social goals and environmental causes often cannot count on approval 
since there is great uncertainty surrounding the way in which rules are interpreted local councils and regions have now started to enlist the services of expensive bureaux 
the task of these experts is to gauge to what extent european commission officials would be prepared to approve plans 
it seems that the key goal there has become the construction and painting of propaganda panels advertising the fact that such and such a project has been co-financed by the european union 
too much money is wasted on propaganda and investigation bureaux consultation and control and a great deal of money ends up back in the country where it was collected in the first place 
after the planned accession of new member states with their million inhabitants the prosperity level of which is at one third or two thirds of the average level of the current eu member states this squandering will generate even more protest 
in the committee on regional policy transport and tourism the confederal group of the european united left was in agreement with the draftsman of the opinion mr nogueira román on leader 
he was right to point out that it is not a good idea to share out this funding between all rural areas 
if there is a choice between investing in innovation projects or injecting most of the funding into bringing on deprived areas we would opt for the latter as this does the most to benefit equality 
after all innovation in areas that have already grown prosperous is paying dividends even now and taking place without european funding 
a second point where we need to focus our attention is the possibility of nepotism and abuse of power within regional and local councils 
the emphasis is on local groups in which the authorities non-profit-making organisations and profit-making companies join forces 
the discussion has centred on the allocation formula to be applied 
in this respect one of the variants considered is reminiscent of the dutch polder model the structurally planned cooperation between government trade unions and employers' organisations 
let us not forget that elections for local councils and regional parliaments are held so as to represent the entire population 
so really these bodies should already provide for a balance and take into account the wishes of the union movement and environmental movement in the process 
my group welcomes the fact that the union movement and environmental movement are expressly given their own roles to play as their input in society is important in our view 
this could prevent local governments that are functioning in a short-sighted or insufficiently democratic way from neglecting their duty of input from the very start 
but the fact that we now fear abuse of power and nepotism indicates that unfortunately democracy is not fully functioning yet 
one of the objections is that due to the restricted role of the elected bodies businesses gain more influence 
as long as the economy does not weigh up the needs of all in a democratic way but is more concerned with making a profit for the benefit of a few it is questionable as to whether democracy functions better under the rule of employers than under the rule of local councils 
mr president there are economic frontiers within the european union and the internal market with the free movement of goods persons services and capital is fully operating at this time 
but for the internal market to work effectively and for the single european currency to be a success it is important that all regions within europe of which there are over can economically compete within this very challenging environment 
some areas within the european union are economically very strong and heavily exceed the average income per capita 
there are poor regions within the union which need to be given european assistance to improve the fabric of their economies so that they can compete within the european union structure 
that is why when we look at the eu financial perspective between and and and we find such a large proportion of the eu budget was put aside for the administration of the european regional development fund and the european social fund 
there are twin problems that still remain for many regions in europe firstly the lack of adequate infrastructure in terms of road water treatment facilities and related transport networks secondly the need to put in place initiatives to combat youth and long-term unemployment which is a constant social problem in many urban and rural parts of europe 
there must always be a commitment to ensuring that we do not only build a europe of the cities alone 
we need to ensure that job creation initiatives are in place to promote employment opportunities in the small- and medium-sized enterprise sector in rural parts of europe as well 
between these three programmes there must be a clear demonstration of the commitment of the eu to promoting cross-border development combating the problems of long-term unemployment and supporting rural development schemes 
mr president quite a few towns and cities within the european union have to contend with deprivation 
the member states do not always have sufficient means at their disposal to address this deprivation adequately 
this is why it is useful for the european union to continue to support the member states and if necessary give additional support under urban 
in common with mrs mccarthy i have to note that the number of areas has been drastically reduced 
it is desirable for member states to have a certain amount of freedom to determine the number of projects themselves within the confines of a certain budget 
as far as the budget is concerned as already stated urban is there to support and complement national policy 
in order to generate extra means if necessary i think it is entirely logical to turn first to the member states and private investors 
consequently we cannot support amendment no of the greens as borne out in the committee meeting 
in addition i am of the opinion that funding for a town or neighbourhood especially where community contributions are concerned should incentivise 
structural support is said to cause subsidy-dependence 
we would then be overreaching ourselves 
i would like to finish off by making a general comment on interreg 
in my opinion funding for cross-border initiatives should only be provided if it is actually required by the regions 
when projects are implemented it is also important that they do not contravene general community legislation 
according to the report issued by the court of auditors on the year this is not an imagined risk 
hence our amendment in order to prevent contradictions between general policy and actual projects 
before i begin i will take the liberty of expressing my consternation at the way in which austria has been prejudged by council representatives 
mr president ladies and gentlemen as part of the reform of the structural funds the community initiatives are being pruned to a total of four 
i welcome the continuation of interreg and the priority which it has been accorded 
however the delayed presentation of the draft guidelines has caused a number of problems 
the regions have not been sufficiently involved in the preparation of the guidelines although this demand was often made in the debate about the reform of the structural funds 
there is no direct transition between interreg ii and iii the practical consequences of which are uncertainty in terms of planning and gaps in funding 
that is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects 
when interreg is implemented it will need to be coordinated and synchronised with the other financial instruments concerned 
this is particularly important in order to increase the efficiency of the funds deployed 
however problems will arise in particular from the fact that under phare for example funds are managed on an annual basis and allocation of appropriations is project-related whereas interreg funds are multiannual and are allocated on a measures-related basis 
this will cause practical problems in the future and i hope that despite this it will be possible to implement interreg effectively 
mr president ladies and gentlemen the community initiative leader proved itself to be an effective instrument to initiate innovative developments and pilot projects both within and outside rural areas 
overlap between support schemes must be avoided and at the same time it must also be possible to exploit any synergistic effects 
in this context the aim of stepping up networking between eligible zones under leader is very welcome 
agriculture is one of the cornerstones of the rural environment and it must be possible for it to have a part in the leader initiative 
in the same way through the leader initiative structural change in agriculture can be supported by creating new jobs in rural areas 
leader must now move into the implementation phase 
the operational programmes need to be approved as quickly as possible by the commission which implies practical and efficient administration of applications and completion of the application approval process as quickly as possible 
five months are provided for this 
that seems to me to be rather too long 
efforts should be made here to achieve shorter times 
because anyone who develops a project and has it ready will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible 
for me this raises the following questions who will work there 
how will these people be selected 
where above all will the required money come from and where should this observatory be located 
in addition experience from other fields where observatories have been set up shows that apart from rather dubiously creating jobs they are not of any great benefit 
assessment and publication are part of this and it has of course assumed responsibility for these in the past 
mr president the majority of the borders which have divided europe for centuries were artificially created separating single geographic spaces and creating serious disparities in terms of balanced development and cohesion 
our internal borders or what remains of them no longer cause wars but they do continue to generate economic backwardness social barriers and a lack of cultural communication between the peoples of europe 
the economic and social cohesion which we propose is based by means of the interreg initiative on territorial cohesion and on the integration of border areas and the outermost regions of our continent 
interreg has always been at the heart of a genuine community policy for regional planning and a truly polycentric notion of our european territory 
although the european parliament supports this initiative our only regret is that we have to approve a resolution on it before we have seen any evaluation of interreg ii 
however we are aware that we must not delay this third version further since otherwise we would be jeopardising the success of various projects and the continuity of the projects which are currently underway 
the success of interreg is clear and that is the opinion of the local regional and national authorities which have participated in the cofinanced projects 
the people who have participated in this initiative have learnt the importance of learning together of innovation of sharing projects and good practices and of understanding and tolerating each other 
there are many interesting questions relating to it the monitoring centre the principle of concentration etc 
however i would like to concentrate on the management bodies 
we must create joint interregional and transnational management bodies in which all local and regional authorities as well as economic and social operators play an active role 
there must not be any repetition of cases of parallel projects on both sides of a border 
we must create a cross-border culture and to this end we must be innovative with regard to administrative cooperation imaginatively overcoming existing barriers and overcoming the difficulties posed by the differing levels of competence in each member state in each region and each municipality 
a project must never fail to be implemented as a result of difficulties in communication 
during debates in committee we have also pointed out the difficulties involved in coordinating interreg with other annual or biannual financial instruments such as meda tacis or phare 
mr president my reason for wanting to contribute to this debate is because the urban initiative in ireland in particular has been quite successful and i am keen that the european union make a further contribution in that area 
it is a sad fact that there are many hundreds if not thousands of communities in the european union suffering very severe poverty and disadvantage 
even in member states and cities that are extremely wealthy we have large numbers of people living in ghettos in situations where there are inadequate facilities where schooling is very poor where the physical infrastructure is under-developed and where drugs and other phenomena are rife 
it seems to me that in order for the european union to demonstrate that it has a role in helping the citizens of the european union it must give assistance to member states to demonstrate that the union works for these citizens and their families 
the programme has been extremely successful in ireland as indeed i know it has been successful in other countries 
it was quite slow in getting off the ground there but it was slow because it was necessary to have the local people themselves develop these programmes 
it is important that they use their initiative and their own local expertise in developing this initiative 
it would be very easy to have these programmes developed quickly and on time if you brought in outside professional experts but that would undermine the whole purpose of the urban programme 
i should like to make one further point before i conclude we should insist where this money is being allocated and where this programme is being developed that it be done in the context of a serious urban development policy 
this unfortunately is not the case in ireland 
i applaud the innovative approach of the equal programme and the aim of integrating discriminated groups into the labour market 
the development partnerships are a very clever idea even though they are experimental 
i have two major concerns however about the development partnerships 
they should be accessible to smaller groups accessible for them to be able to devise implement and monitor the programmes 
we need to have a wide element of flexibility within the programme 
i have also expressed concern in the past about the use of simple language and not using jargon so that it becomes accessible to everyone 
i am glad to see that this was accepted into the report but i cannot agree with amendment no because that amendment really is not expressed in simple language at all 
projects should also specifically address this problem 
these concerns must be looked at while setting up the programmes 
i certainly intend to do that with organisations and groups in my constituency in the west midlands 
i now turn to the controversial issue of asylum-seekers and refugees 
although i am not in favour of those refugees who have been refused refugee status and threatened with repatriation having access to equal i would support the possibility of access for all other asylum-seekers and refugees 
it is only fair and right for them to be able to access equal in the same way as everyone else 
thank you mr president 
ladies and gentlemen with the leader report rural development is very much to the fore 
it must be pointed out that these programmes have not only been instrumental in structuring regional planning but have also been vital instruments for economic and social cohesion in often vulnerable areas such as for example areas experiencing depopulation 
it must be stressed that in order to become eligible under the leader programme local operators have combined forces debated and prepared projects 
these programmes have therefore been important channels for participative democracy the rationale of the citizen for europe 
are there so many other european schemes which can boast specific original experiments which were particularly successful 
for how much longer is the commission going to leave leader at the experimental stage instead of bringing it online as part of the general concept of mainstreaming of rural development 
at a time when commissioner after seattle we europeans are fighting on the grounds of multifunctionality in rural development projects why should we confine ourselves to a few limited criteria with resources that are far from sufficient 
as an ecologist let met tell you that the precautionary principle and sustainable development require much more diversified and many-sided approaches 
in this connection the commission is proposing to limit yet further the cooperation actions of local action groups to only candidate countries 
the fact is showing solidarity with eastern europe is all very well but it is not enough 
the tradition which has already been established by the previous programmes with the countries of the south particularly the countries around the mediterranean must not be abandoned 
therefore once more we can stress that what the area of agriculture and rural development really needs is codecision 
codecision would give us effective means to progress programmes of this type which require cooperation and cross-disciplinary application 
mr president i have a few very brief comments 
we are debating the planning phase and guidelines for the four community initiatives without access to any substantive and complete appraisal of the previous period 
this is not very good at all 
programmes and objectives usually turn out to be far too ambitious and their results are not always satisfactory while the lack of transparency and complexity of the plans often allow considerable scope for mismanagement and even fraud 
the community initiatives we are debating could play a positive part subject to certain preconditions 
they must however not be subordinated to the objectives and aspirations of a more generally negative economic and social policy but must develop their own self-sufficient role 
for example adapting equal to the objectives of employability and the flexibilisation of labour relations transforms this initiative into a new version of local employment contracts 
extending the leader initiative to every area in the union entails the risk of marginalising deprived areas even more to the benefit of more developed areas 
mr president rural development has been identified by this parliament and the commission as a priority policy area and i would like to welcome here today the commissioner responsible commissioner fischler 
our response to rural decline has come late in the day but i suppose better late than never 
family farming is now recognised as central to the european agricultural model and is an objective to be addressed certainly within the time-scale of agenda 
in my view the next five years will decide the future of thousands of marginal family farms 
it behoves all of us to do everything possible to ensure their survival 
as the commissioner knows farming alone will not be sufficient to ensure the sustainability of rural communities 
for this reason we need the coordination of all policy areas capable of impacting positively on rural development 
in this regard leader has established itself as an effective development initiative 
it provides the opportunity for local communities to identify their development potential and become actively involved in addressing those problems 
the voluntary participation of people in development programmes is something that is not always fully appreciated 
yet through leader there can be no doubting its effectiveness as an integral part of broader eu and national policy 
i urge you to look seriously at this problem 
a break in continuity will have serious consequences for the programme and certainly a disruptive effect on voluntary and professional workers 
i should also like to give my considered support to the comments of the committee on regional policy transport and tourism particularly and primarily in deploring the failure to integrate the most remote regions into strand a of the programme or in commenting upon the lack of precision in the selection criteria for the implementation methods for strand iii c and finally in requesting that members of the european parliament should be involved in the european observatory for cross-border transregional and interregional cooperation 
i should further like to express major reservations with regard to the exaggerated tendency which in the commission communication with reference to interreg iii and iii b involves associating environmental protection exclusively with the development of natura which i think is often an excessively abstract means of safeguarding ecosystems from which users are in danger of being excluded or severely restricted 
finally if the commission and the relevant councils of ministers permit i should like to stress that the members of the european parliament should be given more information on the procedures relating to the implementation of the interreg projects and beyond that of similar initiatives 
it would be even better if they were involved to a greater extent in the processes of framing and implementing the programmes concerned otherwise it will be difficult to determine and defend their role in relation to the local and national authorities and even the citizens 
mr president first of all i would like thank the rapporteur of the equal report mrs stenzel very warmly for all the efforts she has made to master this very complex subject matter on behalf of all of us 
equal is a very difficult programme because it attempts to combine so many old programmes and yet aims to view them in a different light doing so with less money than was available in the previous funds 
this is an arduous task 
only the number of people affected by these programmes has not really dropped 
this is why it is so hard to strike a balance not only between the different countries or the different components but especially between the different groups listed in the programme and in fact this is what has preoccupied us to date 
comments are made here and there to the effect that one group should get more funding than another 
i for my part have focused on the position of the handicapped and the elderly within the framework of the programme and i have to say that their position could well have been overlooked altogether if it had not been for the european parliament devoting special attention to them 
although a few other groups have been mentioned it is the member states in particular which are on the lookout 
for example i know of one member state that would like to use a large proportion of the entire programme for one component namely refugees 
i would therefore ask the commissioner to ensure that a balance is struck between these different groups 
it should not be the case that one member state under the pretext of calling on the subsidiarity principle can decide that all funding should go to one group 
i think that this will have to be monitored closely because otherwise we will end up in that situation against which mr meijer has warned us so vehemently to wit that vested interests will emerge and that people will think that the money is theirs to spend 
this is not the case 
it has to be redistributed time and again 
that is not the intention and that is an important point that we need to bear in mind here 
i believe that the remaining problems that we have faced within this parliament and which in large part stem from the fact that it is so difficult to strike the right balance can be solved 
as far as the commission is concerned i hope it will be able to join in the compromise that is being concluded here in this parliament mainly with a view to reaching a balance 
i would just like to underline this the situation is of course a little precarious parliament has for the sake of convenience and safety placed the equal programme on the back burner for the time being so that parliament has yet to be persuaded of the way the funds are to be distributed 
i believe that this is actually a good thing 
the position of parliament in this whole procedure is somewhat unclear 
the rules of procedure do not shed any more light on the matter and that is exactly why this back burner is extremely useful 
mr president there is no doubt that the interreg initiative promotes efforts to achieve economic and social cohesion in the european union 
for greece for the neighbouring countries italy and austria but also for europe as a whole the social and economic restoration of the balkans bringing political stability is a vitally important matter 
so far some balkan countries have received aid from the phare and obnova programmes while others have not 
during the new programme period in view of enlargement and bearing in mind that funding has been provided for from new financial instruments and regulations such as ispa and sapard it is considered absolutely essential to coordinate the funding of all three strands of interreg with other financial aid to third countries 
the efforts to coordinate the planning and so make it more effective must extend to all the programmes equally and i say that because in the meda programme during the last period some problems arose which have to be overcome so that we can have equal treatment for all the third countries participating in that programme 
we therefore ask the commission to pay special attention to the issue of maritime and island cooperation when zone planning next comes up for review 
i end by stressing the need for the european union to persist with such initiatives which strive to eliminate inequalities between our regions and to foster their harmonious development 
mr president commissioner fischler rural development can and must tackle the problem from three different angles preservation of jobs stewardship of the countryside and not least local culture because that is of the utmost importance 
only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assured 
we can observe the consequences of migration from the countryside in several areas of the alps and they are devastating 
but i warn against using these programmes to take urban culture to the countryside 
and neither should we create structures which are reliant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them forevermore 
to really guarantee sustainability a buzzword which has since it gained new currency become relatively devoid of meaning but we all know what we mean by it what is needed amongst other things is an integrated approach in the countryside towards for example tourism and agriculture 
the investment needs to be visionary 
young creative individuals must be made to feel an attachment to the countryside 
if they all leave then nothing much will go on there any more 
none of us think much of the principle of indiscriminate all-round distribution and the pilot projects need to act as it were like avalanches and trigger other similar projects 
i would be in favour of supporting self-contained cycles of projects and even though leader i and leader ii may have had shortcomings here and there overall they were certainly positive 
i should like to ask that we consider granting derogations not only in the nordic countries but also for mountainous areas the alps the pyrenees and the sierra nevada from where i have just returned in respect of population size and density 
mr president i want to talk about the equal report especially the issue of the policy on refugees 
last week we had a very impassioned discussion about the formation of the austrian government 
the most startling aspect of her original report was that she wanted to limit aid to the small group of refugees covered by the geneva convention that is to say so-called quota refugees or un refugees 
in actual fact it is the other refugees namely those outside the quota and those not covered by un aid who need aid the most 
the committee rejected this discriminatory proposal and decided that all refugees should have a place on the equal programme on identical conditions 
it is therefore crucially important that the chamber should be as emphatic as it possibly can be in establishing the fact that all refugees are to have a place on the equal programme 
i want finally to say that i had certain misgivings last week when we discussed the formation of the austrian government but when it comes to discussing and criticising its policy on refugees i have no misgivings 
i hope that the chamber will be just as committed this time 
mr president during the last eu financial perspective from to when there were different initiatives in operation the interreg ii cross-border programme was an important initiative 
the fact that the next round of structural funds includes the interreg initiative is i believe a very clear indication of the importance which is attached to it by national eu member states 
the interreg i programme between and and the interreg ii programme between and have proved an absolute success in terms of bridging closer social and economic development between bordering member states 
coming from the border counties in the north-west of ireland i have seen over the years the important role which interreg i and ii have played and i am delighted to welcome interreg iii 
the commission is allocating million pounds towards the interreg iii programme which will be spent on continuing the development of cross-border economic projects between the republic of ireland and northern ireland 
the european union has played a key role in developing the border county region in ireland over the years 
the european union is the single largest contributor with million pounds to the international fund for ireland 
the european union contributes % of the peace and reconciliation programme 
all in all interreg the international fund for ireland and the peace and reconciliation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process 
mr president i am taking the floor to speak about interreg but i shall confine myself to a few criticisms which will clearly also enable me to keep to my speaking time 
however this does not blind us to the fact that the majority of resources % will be reserved for cross-border cooperation for interreg iiia 
therefore we still think the decision to consolidate the current areas of cooperation in this strand regarding the selection of eligible regions is wrong and contradictory 
cross-border cooperation continues almost exclusively to be an issue concerning landlocked areas and where exceptions have been made for maritime areas their selection is not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other community policies 
this discrimination is much more serious for islands that have a regional status that can only be linked to areas of an exclusively maritime nature 
this is in line with ongoing discrimination which ignores article of the treaty on island regions with regard to cohesion policies 
more serious still is the fact that this is occurring while ignoring the new situation associated with the approach that has been adopted towards the enlargement process for the inclusion of regions such as malta 
this has given rise to the proposals we are making to at least extend the regions eligible to include the nuts iii sicilian provinces which have a frontier with malta and to include all the regions of the adriatic which share a frontier with balkan regions 
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen i should like to express the satisfaction i have in noting that the most remote regions including the french overseas departments have received some attention in connection with the interreg iii initiative opening up new perspectives for their cooperation with other countries in their geographical area even though it is true that more could have been expected particularly with regard to access to the various strands 
for a long time probably a survival of our colonial heritage our regions have fixed their attention on the european mainland ignoring and even scorning their closest neighbours 
that time is now past 
our regions have become aware of belonging to an environment that they are connected to not only in geographical terms but also in terms of their culture and the history of their peoples hence the intensely expressed aspiration to become more deeply rooted in this environment 
this increased awareness does not however affect identity alone 
it is fostered by a fair appraisal of our assets 
so for example the island of réunion is located on a trade axis between the countries of southern africa and those of south-east asia 
it cannot afford to remain outside the regional alliances being forged in this area lest it miss out on a historic opportunity and the same applies to our regions in the caribbean 
at last we are convinced that our young people may start to see an end to the tragic unemployment the source of so much despair if we can export to neighbouring countries the know-how which we have gained thanks to the operation of the european structural funds 
interreg appropriations may be used to make our regions into veritable european union bridgeheads into these geographical areas giving it worldwide scope 
i am counting on the commission and specifically on you commissioner to allocate adequate resources for effective action 
mr president commissioners i greatly welcome the possibilities for increased trans-european cooperation under interreg but my concern is that the proposal offers fewer opportunities in this respect for maritime than for other areas 
nonetheless there are many maritime areas between which links are already established 
various local authorities around the north sea provide a prime example of this 
interreg could well allow enhancement of such cooperation 
in consequence i seek some small adjustments to the guidelines to provide a little more flexibility and to accommodate the ways in which the interests of maritime areas can fall between strand a and strand b these adjustments include clarifying the possibilities for cooperation between maritime areas and permitting greater development of practical and visible projects particularly those of an infrastructural kind 
such measures will put maritime and insular areas on an equal footing with other areas of the eu 
i hope for their adoption 
mr president our group welcomes the horizontal thrust of the equal initiative so that if you are a british muslim physically disabled in some way you no longer have to chose which category of discrimination you belong to as a target group you can use your expertise and experience to solve problems rather than being defined as the problem 
there is a lot of expertise within the relevant organisations which deserves to be shared 
we also welcome the recognition of the need for evaluation and the dissemination of best practice for the tightening up of the transnational level 
my group will not be supporting those amendments 
we are also concerned at the number of amendments which in seeking to introduce greater flexibility run the risk perhaps of obscuring responsibility for the management of the equal initiative 
mr president i am very pleased to see urban orientated towards a more integrated approach which attempts to solve interrelated problems 
yet there is some risk of dilution of effort 
if we pursue too many objectives our overall effectiveness suffers 
of course every instance of a deprived urban area is a separate case 
but there is a common factor a hard core comprising unemployment the resignation or withdrawal of public services and the disappearance of small and medium-sized enterprises both commercial and other kinds 
i would wish urban to be orientated mainly towards providing answers to those causes of urban deprivation 
for this of course central policy must interact and be coordinated with development policy so that the latter too can be reorientated and can work synergistically with the objectives of any urban programmes implemented in our countries and so that it is not just using them as an alibi for its own shortcomings 
the interreg community initiative programme is an extremely important tool in terms of the development and regional planning of european territory most particularly with reference to effectively taking into account the relationship between the centre of the european union and its outlying regions 
interreg must therefore be an instrument promoting territorial cohesion throughout the union if we do not wish to see a two- or even three-speed european territory 
it is obvious to me that the regional and local authorities and their representative bodies the committee of the regions and of course the european parliament should have been involved in the clearest way possible and at the earliest possible opportunity framing this programme 
indeed i am forced to observe that this was not the case when the commission drew up its communication published on october last year 
even though i approve of the general guidelines of interreg iii i feel it is extremely important to ensure better coordination between this programme financed by the erdf and the other external cooperation funds including in particular the european development fund intended for acp countries 
in this connection i should like to thank the committee on regional policy transport and tourism for adopting one of my amendments adding the edf to the list of these funds 
the most remote regions particularly the four french overseas departments must be able to coordinate interreg iii and the edf in order to fund in turn cooperation projects with their acp neighbours in their respective geographical areas 
furthermore i would ask the commission to please reconsider the limited opportunities that have been offered to the most remote and island regions according to the guidelines put forward in the communication 
it is essential for these regions to be able to benefit fully from interreg iii just like all the other regions in the union especially now that the regis programme dedicated to such isolated regions has been dropped 
finally in conclusion i would like to express my regret at the low level of funding allocated to strand c for interregional cooperation even though the added value this offers the community is undeniable 
mr president my starting point is the equal report and equality between men and women although i must admit that it is sometimes hard to talk about this issue which has a feeling of déjà vu about it when you are my age in any case 
unfortunately it is necessary to point out again that we do not have equality 
a breakthrough in this regard may perhaps lead to changes in other areas however 
for me equality certainly does not mean that both parties to a marriage work the whole time and hand the children over to a nanny alias an immigrant who has not had the opportunity to obtain another job 
if that is the case we have not progressed one little bit since pagan times 
no equality means that we all participate in both working life and family life 
unfortunately developments are not moving in that direction 
on the contrary 
i think therefore that paragraph contains something very central i.e that equal will be used as a testing ground for developing and promoting new ways of delivering employment policies 
one can only hope that it succeeds 
one of the reasons why it has been so successful is that the basic concept of the leader programmes aroused substantial interest in activities amongst the population concerned 
there is a problem however which we need to address together 
because leader is a kind of workshop with a bottom-up approach a huge number of ideas have come to fruition in recent years through leader i and ii which of course at some point will no longer be brand new or as successful as they once were 
that is why where the good leader projects are concerned we need to ensure that those which have proved to be outstanding are not suddenly discontinued instead the ideas which have proved to be worthwhile need at some stage to be transferred into the standard programmes as a reliable positive component of our support to rural areas 
of course this is also the basic idea 
it is to take new ideas and try them out in leader with the participants on the ground with the local organisations on the ground with many non-governmental organisations with the churches with all those who have helped actually to get new ideas up and running in rural communities 
here we must ensure that the good schemes those which are really excellent are then somehow transferred into rural development policy to safeguard the future of this laudable work 
my request to the commission is that it should make sure that the organisations and sections of the population which get involved really are accepted 
there should be no attempt to have one or other organisation which is just being formed with a view to contributing a new idea and is not yet so well known pushed a little on to the sidelines say because of official local or regional policy 
have faith in the successful results which leader has had so far 
at the beginning it is sometimes a little like chasing a rainbow if we say that a plan is too idealistic 
and then when the work and the action start something emerges which the official policy including ourselves at this level could never have imagined would suddenly have developed so well 
that was the charm of leader and that should please not be lost 
mr president i welcome the equal initiative and the report which highlights the need to distinguish between actions to combat discrimination against women and actions to combat discrimination against minority groups 
women are not a minority and often suffer double discrimination as members of minority groups as well as because of their gender 
this is why specific action for women is needed as well as mainstreaming 
the report addresses this and proposes integrating action to achieve equality between women and men in all aspects of work it also recognises the importance of working with local and regional bodies which are those closest to the people to help ensure that all project results are mainstreamed 
the involvement of voluntary and community groups will also be an essential ingredient of the equal initiative and the projects 
the development partnerships within the thematic fields which are referred to in amendment no would enable even the smaller organisations to play a part in the equal initiative 
my group will be supporting amendment no 
mr president the report under discussion in the house today is doubtless of great importance 
in addition to the objectives it is working towards the strong point of the community initiative interreg for the programming period lies in its added value from the viewpoint of what is now the imminent enlargement of the european union to include new eastern european and mediterranean countries 
in my opinion it is precisely in anticipation of this deadline that the european union should strive to reduce disparities between regions and put an end to the isolation of border areas 
indeed these areas and it is right to stress this have an important role to play as an interface with the applicant countries that are going to join the union 
it is precisely with this in mind that i tabled some amendments which i consider to be of the utmost importance and that the committee on regional policy transport and tourism has subsequently taken up 
they call for the areas eligible for cross-border cooperation to be extended to all regions of the adriatic as well as to the sicilian provinces which have a frontier with malta an applicant country which inexplicably are not currently included in strand a annex 
there are fundamental advantages for the whole of europe for it to promote cooperation with the applicant countries and to support border regions 
finally it is to be hoped that greater coordination will be sought between the interreg initiative and the existing community programmes which are significant for external policy as a vector for greater integration and for the joint drafting of programmes 
mr president commissioners ladies and gentlemen leader i was an outright success due in particular to the great flexibility of the administrative management between the commission and the local operators 
it is i think regrettable that the commission could not make a similar assessment of leader ii regarding the quality of the projects the quantity of appropriations spent and most especially the demotivation of some local operators in the face of the administrative and financial unwieldiness they encountered 
i feel it is important to put special emphasis on trying out new ways to raise the profile of the natural and cultural heritage and to strengthen the economic environment in order to promote employment 
the time is now right i think to consider including the exchange of positive development experience in the scope of transnational cooperation 
it is interesting to note that all rural areas may be eligible for leader ii 
nonetheless if the opportunity for member states to determine the areas within the scope of this initiative remains available then the commission will have to ensure a certain focusing of resources and prioritise projects in the less prosperous areas 
there must of course be transparency regarding the selection criteria for projects and local action groups 
i also feel there are grounds for ensuring in particular that the financial channels of states or local authorities are not behind the delays in payment which may have caused some lags to become bankrupt under leader ii 
mr president as a member from one of the outermost regions i must point out that this is a very special afternoon as far as regional policy is concerned because of the debate on two community initiatives urban and interreg 
i would like to remind you that these initiatives are aimed firstly in the case of urban at improving the quality of life of the citizens who live in the poorer parts of various european cities and in the case of interreg at facilitating cohesion and recognising the diversity and potential of the regions of the european union particularly by including the outermost regions in strands b and c 
like the rapporteur we deplore the fact that it has been excluded from strand iiia 
with regard to interreg we are very happy that there is a reference to the creation of a european monitoring centre concerned with cooperation 
i would like to thank the rapporteurs particularly mr decourrière for his sensitivity towards the regions and for accepting our amendments 
i hope that the commissioner will accept the proposal which we are making 
mr president with regard to the various initiatives which we are analysing this afternoon i would like to concentrate strictly on one of them that is the urban programme 
it is a fact that we are debating this programme today because the european parliament insisted that this initiative should be maintained 
i believe that we should be pleased about this 
its argument was one of priority 
the urban question is so important that we cannot tighten our belts and undervalue it with a programme which has such a small budget 
today the programme is in place and therefore i believe we have achieved something important that distinguishing mark of the european union called the urban programme 
however i would like to address commissioner barnier and support the argument of commissioner wulf-mathies and the director-general because i think they were absolutely right 
the urban dimension must be incorporated much more deeply in all the structural funds 
the amount of budget required by our cities where % of the european population live and which increasingly represent both the best and the worst of what we have in europe i believe clearly indicates that the european dimension should be taken into account and that this urban programme should not be used as an excuse not to analyse in detail not to prioritise and therefore not to introduce an infinitely greater budgetary contribution into programmes which affect the cities by means of european funds 
therefore i do not believe i need to restate the number of factors which demand this investment in urban areas factors which are on the agenda and i would like to say to the commissioner that we hope he will be sensitive in this respect 
in welcoming the cross-sectoral approach embodied in the new equal initiative it is crucial that the programme addresses the distinct forms of discrimination which militate against disabled people in particular physical barriers in the workplace affecting those with limited mobility visual information systems which exclude blind workers working systems which effectively close the door on people with learning difficulties or with mental health problems 
that is why this parliament has put forward paragraphs and of the resolution to ensure that member states cannot ignore any one target group 
disabled people have too often been left off the list 
because disabled people do not form one homogenous group for example many deaf people see themselves as a linguistic minority denied respect for their own language and culture it is necessary as stated in paragraph to enable some partnerships to be defined which are specific to a particular disability or other group 
equal remains crucial also to regions like my own in the east of england outside the principal funds of objective i we have had an extra incentive to take up community initiative funding and an excellent record in response 
former adapt projects range from the core project which has developed new supply chains for the car industry in bedfordshire to projects to raise standards in small businesses in hertfordshire in essex 
we have seen the now project helping women to return to work in suffolk many of whom were able to come and share the results of their experience directly with us at the european parliament in brussels 
equal remains important to us because it is precisely in relatively more prosperous regions that lower-skilled jobs are being shed which can be an important first destination for those discriminated against in the labour market 
finally a word on interreg 
it really is quite nonsensical that partnerships set up in are being rolled over now to the exclusion of new inter-regional links 
during this period the ports of great yarmouth and harwich on the essex-suffolk-norfolk coast have launched significant new transportation and economic links with partners in the netherlands 
i urge parliament to support our amendment no which would ensure flexibility so as to include new areas particularly on maritime borders 
mr president commissioner ladies and gentlemen for the information of the house mr president i should like to make a clarification 
there is no change in refugee policy in austria 
as a farmer and member of parliament i have always endeavoured not to look at agriculture in isolation but to see rural areas as a whole 
i attach particular importance to adopting an integrated approach towards rural development because i am convinced that only cooperation linking up all people from all walks of life in rural areas will permit them to be active and attractive places to live for everyone i refer in short to the multifunctionality of rural areas 
in the future it will be possible to have programmes not only in the individual zones eligible for structural aid but in all the regions of the eu 
this across-the-board approach is sensible because the programmes for rural development are also structured in this way 
in the future funding will no longer come from three funds but from the eaggf guidance section alone 
it will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programmes because the eaggf is supposed to be an effective financial instrument 
greater precision in the selection process will lead to greater effectiveness because the money should not be squandered recklessly 
in addition i should particularly like to emphasise the point which offers an approach towards creating an integrated and environmentally friendly development strategy 
there is great potential for future job creation in rural areas here and we must exploit this if we wish to offer fresh prospects to people living in the countryside 
that is why policy for rural areas is more than a policy just for farmers 
mr president ladies and gentlemen i am not always proud of the fuss that goes on here in parliament but the urban programme is one of the best examples of our work it was created following an initiative in parliament 
the commission would have abolished urban but this time parliament drew the longer straw 
it is good that urban is to continue as it has had good results at local level 
the majority of the population of europe live in cities and their problems are among the most pressing within the context of regional policy and very complex matters in themselves 
there is an immense risk of exclusion 
in many cities in france and england there are now slums breeding grounds for many sorts of problems 
none of us wants south american type favelas in europe 
we have to act now before it is too late 
we always come back to the same basic problem in europe our economy does not support the individual sufficiently nor is it sufficiently dynamic 
the economy has to be strong for us to be able to attend to the problems of our fellow-citizens and our environment 
it is good that spending has become focused as otherwise the buckshot gets scattered to the four winds 
now we have to concentrate on solving problems in small and middle-size towns and cities as they do not have enough resources 
in this way we will also be able to speed up matters in surrounding rural areas it is often forgotten that urban and rural problems in fact go hand in hand 
the basis for all this is that we should be encouraging individual innovation and entrepreneurship as group action begun by the individual will help revitalise an area internally 
granting funds without an economy that can stand on its own two feet is like carrying water to fill up a dry well there will be enough to drink for a while but tomorrow the well will be dry again 
mr president with the implementation of interreg iii european cooperation policy is entering a new phase 
our attention is no longer focused exclusively on internal borders but also on external ones 
in the context of globalisation and cultural openness which characterise the current situation the european union needs instruments that will allow it to strengthen its links and communication channels with neighbouring regions particularly in eastern and southern europe 
in its draft guidelines the commission acknowledges that these borders require greater attention than they did in the past 
this is on account of the process of enlargement to the east and that of greater integration with the mediterranean countries 
as president prodi too mentioned when outlining the strategic objectives for the period boosting the barcelona process is a priority for the union and the interreg iii initiative will be able to make its contribution to the pursuit of this strategic objective 
in congratulating the rapporteur on his excellent work we can but hope that the commission will duly take into consideration the proposals parliament has put forward in accordance with the commitments made under the code of conduct on the implementation of structural policies and that it will confirm with fitting amendments the transformation of this community initiative from a mere instrument for internal redistribution to an opportunity to boost and enhance relations with neighbouring countries 
mr president from this year until the year around eur billion is available for the structural funds but only % is set aside for the community initiatives interreg leader urban and equal 
that is a reduction of % compared with the previous cis 
this makes the large number of amendments and far too long a wish list of possible tasks all the more astonishing 
how are priorities supposed to be set here 
there is agreement on the principle that marginalisation discrimination and inequalities on the labour market should be reduced 
transnational strategies are intended to make it possible for disadvantaged groups to have access to jobs 
i have no sympathy for amendments once again backing the taos 
our committee on employment and social affairs was after all in overall charge of analysing considerable shortcomings and failures to carry out checks in cases related to leonardo 
the commission cannot therefore be relieved of direct responsibility or the task of carrying out inspections under equal either 
it can only approve member states' proposals if they fulfil all the criteria firstly integration through sectoral and geographical development partnerships whereby the employment policy guidelines need to be taken into account secondly the systematic involvement of the operators concerned the local regional and national authorities training institutions universities ngos the two sides of industry and the private sector with the aim of creating a durable partnership and thirdly methods and models of indisputably innovative character 
the commission must therefore be the guarantor of the strategic framework for promoting ability to work and quality of work of the assessment of results and of the effective communication of best practices 
only then will it be possible for the desired multiplier effect to be achieved 
mr president i want to refer to the commission proposals on the budget line to promote the cap 
on october the european commission adopted a proposal to ensure that a legal basis is given to the budget line informing the public about the cap 
this proposal will remove the current budget line and create a new budget heading 
actions which promote understanding between young farmers and the eu and also create stronger links with eu candidate countries and the outside world are important 
therefore i am putting forward these amendments to parliament to give its support to the contributions of this type of programme 
given the need to encourage young farmers to continue in farming it is vitally important that they are well-informed about developments in the common agricultural policy 
informing and training young farmers at european level is vitally important 
i would ask you to support that part of the available budget should be concentrated on the development of knowledge amongst european young farmers 
regarding information and training in the past this budget line has been allocated for information communication and training 
but the commission is now proposing that training should no longer be included 
i feel that training should be included where it provides relevant information at european level about the cap 
such european training is one element in ensuring that young farmers have the necessary knowledge of the cap to make sound business decisions for the future 
therefore i am putting forward three amendments 
i would urge parliament to support them 
mr president i am taking the floor to express my opinion drawn from my experience of municipal administration that the urban projects should or rather must have a threefold purpose firstly to promote the restoration of infrastructure and historic old and perhaps dilapidated areas of cities 
secondly to promote and stimulate economic activity and social life within these historic centres within these old quarters of our cities 
there is little point in having streets which are now wonderfully lit with new pavements with newly paved road surfaces all whitewashed and beautiful if we are not able to fill them with activity and therefore employment 
i would like to make it clear that it is not just a question of finance or aid to the different social operators but rather also of selecting those projects which are aimed at employment or to put it another way projects which will tend to favour the creation and promotion of jobs 
thirdly and perhaps this should be the first objective the projects should principally be aimed at the complete rehabilitation of people and families because man is not made for the law but rather law is made for man 
these areas of our cities are often home to single-parent families elderly people who receive a pension and no longer carry out productive activity and families facing difficulties sometimes they are families which have broken down and which are excluded from mainstream society 
these people live in areas which should benefit from these projects 
if we have success in this threefold sense i believe that these families these people these european citizens will believe more in europe and this seems to me to be very important because ultimately the cities will increasingly come to play a leading role in european life 
mr president commissioner it is clear today that agriculture alone is less and less able to sustain communities in rural areas particularly in the case of young people 
the recently published 6th periodic report on the european regions demonstrates this clearly by revealing that the most heavily agricultural regions in the european union have the highest rate of unemployment in addition to their traditional problems of an ageing population and desertification 
that is why the commission gradually and unfortunately too slowly has been launching initiatives which will in time balance out or complement the cap by increasing the coverage of all the endogenous resources in rural areas and by utilising them for initiatives and investments which will increase prosperity and employment for communities farming or other communities 
that was the intention of the recent policy on rural development launched in the agenda reform 
first of all it is crucial that the choice of local action groups responsible for organising and operating the projects should not be influenced by politics 
instead the choice should be made solely on the basis of the projects' merits 
preference should be given to those projects most closely involved with private organisations more than % of which should never be made up of lag partners 
i have therefore proposed an amendment to this effect which the committee on agriculture has adopted and which i hope the plenary will also adopt 
thirdly i would like to remind you that after leader must no longer merely be a community pilot initiative but must form a rural development component of the cap which i think should be called the common agricultural regional and rural policy 
i would like to congratulate mr procacci on his excellent report 
 
straight away i should like to express my thanks to the rapporteurs from the committees from all the committees but also to the speakers for the groups and to each and every one of you for the quality of your speeches and the great interest they express with regard to these two initiatives 
this is particularly true of what mrs mccarthy said about urban 
i should like to thank her not only for her work and for the report which she presented but also and i do not see why i in turn should not say so too for all we owe her for all you owe her as far as this is initiative as well as more generally all we owe parliament 
i am mindful of the fact that it was in fact the european parliament which made the political decision and supported the continuation of this initiative for the regeneration of urban areas in difficulties in favour of sustainable urban development involving at the same time this integrated approach which we value to handle the economic social and environmental aspects simultaneously 
i think however that you will all recognise your own comments 
firstly on the subject of the urban programme and the maximum threshold of fifty towns which a number of you termed arbitrary 
i can understand your concern 
i have therefore asked my services to be willing to consider a reasonable increase in the number of towns eligible under the urban programme conditional upon certain guarantees firstly on concentration i am thinking particularly of the target areas which must have a minimum of or in exceptional cases inhabitants and also upon the critical mass of funding we must keep to eur per inhabitant so that the european union action may be both effective and clear and so that it does not resemble a sort of scattering of resources which would have no real impact either for citizens or for municipalities 
that is my initial response to the threshold question 
regarding a second matter now relating to the additional criteria which should be taken into consideration in selecting disadvantaged areas 
here too i am willing to demonstrate greater flexibility and to consider other relevant criteria in addition to the community criteria given in point of the guidance project 
third point specific measures in favour of some social groups some speakers mentioned them women but also immigrants and refugees must be envisaged 
this concern ladies and gentlemen lies at the very heart of our urban initiative and i am willing to rewrite the text if necessary in order to make this message clearer yet 
regarding urban i should like to conclude with the implementation procedure and mention first of all the selection procedure 
some speakers wanted it to be less bureaucratic more transparent and to avoid redundancy in terms of the projects and funding 
ladies and gentlemen on this point we must make it clear in the context of subsidiarity the selection of zones or municipalities eligible for urban is primarily the responsibility of the member states 
as far as the commission is concerned it is willing to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload but we cannot give up the practice of checking the relevance and quality of the proposed programmes indeed you would be the first to criticise us if we did 
a second observation the time limits for the submission of programmes and the possibility of submitting a planning supplement in addition to the programmes 
i have no objection to the idea of submitting a planning supplement jointly with the main programme 
this cannot however be grounds for an extension of the original time limit 
let me remind you that the time limit for this programme is six months 
this time limit which indeed is identical to the one we granted for interreg and for the objective docups should normally be adequate i feel for drawing up a programme which does not mean that the projects cannot be defined at a later stage 
with regard to urban i should like to conclude with a final observation 
one of you expressed a wish that these urban issues should not be confined to the urban initiative 
i agree completely 
i myself expressed my concern at the meeting of ministers for regional and urban planning a concern to which i devote myself that in the docups and the csfs in the planning which we are currently starting to negotiate my concern as i said that apart from the urban initiative urban issues should be addressed in all the objective and objective programmes and i believe i can express both our awareness of such issues and also our commitment to include them beyond the scope of urban in all structural fund programming 
but as for the future since we must look ahead i am extremely concerned to see how urban is going to be implemented in practical terms and also to see what our experience will be and what lessons we can learn because plainly these urban issues are going to be the focus of what may be for future financial perspectives a new european regional planning policy 
i am not forgetting and we cannot forget that % of the citizens of europe today live in towns and that is why this urban instrument is extremely important 
let me repeat what i have said we shall be most attentive to the inclusion of urban issues in all structural fund programming 
i should now mr president like to bring up the subject of interreg and to thank the rapporteur francis decourrière in the same way that i thanked arlene mccarthy for the quality and relevance of his work 
he stressed a number of points with which we may indicate our agreement as many of you did too the importance of this trans-european cooperation with its three strands cross-border transnational interregional the added value to the community provided by interreg its clarity in relation to the general framework of the structural funds and the truly cross-border and transnational strengthening of eligible programmes and operations the importance of common structures and what in discussing another debate which begins today the intergovernmental conference i termed the common european spirit which we have to strengthen and here with interreg thanks to interreg is a way to strengthen common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programmes with real financial solidarity the importance of partnership in guaranteeing the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as private sector associations and economic and social partners 
having made these general observations i should like to focus on your main comments with regard to interreg 
the first relate to the timetable and the content of this initiative 
you comment that these guidelines were adopted at too late a date stressing particularly your rapporteur the risk that the previous programmes will be interrupted 
it is true i admit it and you are well aware of the reasons ladies and gentlemen 
there is a delay in adopting the interreg guidelines in march or april 
i accept this i take note of it as you do 
i note however that the member states and the regions are already actively preparing the programmes for interreg iii and indeed the guidance project was distributed over three months ago now 
i also note that eligibility for expenditure shall be accepted from the date that programmes are presented and i can confirm the possibility that they may be available retroactively back to january if the programme is presented before april 
so much for the first comment 
as to the second comment regarding the non-comprehensive list of measures eligible under strand b i wish to inform you to confirm that i have asked the commission to accept the inclusion of other specific subjects particularly in favour of small- and medium-sized businesses and of cultural heritage in the list of schemes eligible under strand b and that therefore this list must no longer be considered as a comprehensive one 
third point interregional cooperation the importance of strand c. the commission shares the observations made by this house regarding the importance of strand c interregional cooperation 
as your rapporteur has requested i shall send you the detailed information regarding the system for the implementation of this strand 
fourth observation the european observatory and the possible use of a technical assistance office 
as you requested i have decided to remove all references to the use of a technical assistance office in the text until the outcome of the debate in progress within the commission on the service outsourcing systems 
in addition to this one overture there is a second which we have already suggested to the member states greater financial flexibility between strand a and strand b thanks to these two overtures especially the first i can say that the commission is willing to examine the case of italian regions and regions of third countries around the adriatic in order to promote the most appropriate cooperation under interreg and with other instruments too as soon as they become available 
i have decided in the end that the most remote regions to which i attach particular importance will be given special priority in the context of the transnational strand of interreg with a cooperation strategy which will aim at improving their links with their neighbours and other member state regions 
i also wish to express my concern to ensure good cooperation between interreg and the edf particularly for the caribbean and the indian ocean 
i adopt and wholeheartedly support this political objective that the seven most remote regions of the union are actually active frontiers of the union even if or precisely because they are remote and located in other regions of the world where we must bring our influence and our action to bear 
another point the coordination between interreg phare tacis and meda 
it is true once again and i accept this objectively that there are still real legal problems 
i do not want to minimise these but progress is being made as far as strand a cooperation with candidate countries is concerned even if the problems related to the management procedures and to the scale of the projects still remain 
the commission must continue along these lines 
i am making a personal commitment to do so 
finally on the subject of technical assistance on which your rapporteur and several of you commented 
it goes without saying that the commission will adhere to the terms of article of the general regulations regarding technical assistance if it is indeed assistance intended to be an instrument useful to structural policy in general 
according to the general regulations however any technical assistance scheme which can claim a connection with a community initiative must be proposed under article and not article 
this means that the ceiling of % mentioned in article does not apply with regard to this type of technical assistance 
i attach great importance ladies and gentlemen in a spirit of discipline and transparency to our nonetheless retaining some financial strands for matters relating to the exchange of experience and information and not to propaganda and to the implementation of networks ensuring good communication of best practice within the union 
my conclusion regarding interreg mr president ladies and gentlemen is that these community initiatives for which i am responsible fulfil a real need and everything that has been said is proof of this 
they also foreshadow a real european regional planning policy within our enlarged union 
the commission attaches the greatest importance to this just as you yourselves do 
i remain at your service in order when the time comes to present the report of previous planning which you request but also to keep you informed regularly as to the implementation of these initiatives in the course of the new planning 
repeating my thanks to each and every one of you and also particularly to arlene mccarthy and francis decourrière i should like to point out that these two initiatives lie within a financial framework with which you are familiar only eur million for urban but this is better than nothing eur billion millions for interreg 
so we are working within this framework and not outside it 
on the subject of these two initiatives then with the light they cast on future strategic and political thinking regarding regional planning and on future financial perspectives let me express our great interest in this constructive dialogue with the european parliament and its committees 
everything that i have just said ladies and gentlemen demonstrates that the commission is resolved to taken the views of parliament into account 
madam president ladies and gentlemen i should like firstly to thank mr procacci for his report 
this initiative should give the countryside new impetus to develop and test new and original ideas ideas which it is then intended should at a later stage be incorporated in the general programmes as models 
the various groups be they environmental organisations or groups concerned with employment have the possibility of taking part in drafting the commission directives 
and there will not be less funds available than in the current period either there will be more 
i should also like to remind you that the idea of setting up an observatory is nothing new 
there was also an observatory under leader i and leader ii 
it has one purpose only and that is precisely to maintain active networking between the individual leader groups 
the cost of this observatory is not permitted to exceed % of the leader budget 
as far as the possibility of having projects containing training initiatives is concerned i might point out that this is precisely a point which we have now integrated into the new rural development policy which means in our view that it is no longer necessary to do this as part of leader 
i now come to the content of the report 
in point parliament calls on the commission to submit an evaluation report on leader ii immediately 
i should simply like to point out that this does not make very much sense at the present time because as you know it is still possible and in fact will be until the end of for leader ii funds to be disbursed 
we will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it 
in point parliament suggests publishing a compendium of examples of successful initiatives 
in response i can only say that this already exists 
it has already been compiled by the commission and i can make a copy available to any member of this house who is interested 
i can only fully share your concern 
i assume that the commission will then be able to adopt the definitive version of the guidelines in march or april 
for all programmes submitted before april of this year it will be possible to backdate the beginning of the period of eligibility to january 
finally under point the motion for a resolution contains seven specific proposals for amendments to the guidelines 
having given them thorough consideration i can tell you that the proposals made under paragraphs and are acceptable to the commission and are adopted 
the amendment proposed under paragraph has in our view been overtaken by events because following consultations with the representatives of the member states in the star committee this point has already been reworded along the lines proposed by parliament 
that therefore leaves only the amendment proposed under paragraph 
the commission can only endorse this request because of course it corresponds precisely to what the commission itself had originally proposed 
i must add however that cooperation between our action groups and similar groups in third countries went too far for the member states 
it will also continue to fight for member states' acceptance of this 
i will comment briefly on the amendments tabled 
here there are only three which the commission cannot accept amendments nos and 
it can accept all of the others either in full or in essence 
madam president ladies and gentlemen it is an exceptionally fortunate circumstance that we are debating the equal initiative in the european parliament just at this time 
recently because of political developments in austria there is growing unease within europe 
political demonstrations are taking place as well as political dialogue 
it is worth stressing that both parliament and the commission must put forward specific policies 
we need specific proposals both for legislation and for action programmes associated with the fight against discrimination and the formation of free and fair societies 
so i will make brief mention of the package against discrimination and take this opportunity to ask the competent parliamentary committees to appoint their rapporteurs so that we can move ahead with the anti-discrimination package as soon as possible 
i now come to the equal initiative which is of course based on article 
the equal initiative relates to all forms of discrimination within the meaning of article namely the fight against discrimination based on race gender age and special needs 
i would particularly like to congratulate mrs stenzel because her effort to reach agreement on the equal initiative has proved exceptionally difficult and complex both because some of the committees involved view the issue in a different light and because it is a very sensitive political issue 
the first comment which has been made by many others too is whether women should be mentioned separately 
i agree that article contains something we have expressed our disagreement about but that is how the treaty stands right now and among the categories of types of discrimination discrimination on the grounds of gender holds equal place 
so on the basis of the treaty as it stands today the equal initiative is structured in that way 
i would like to remind you however that there is a special axis for the employment strategy which relates to women and that a special programme is being prepared the fifth programme for equality between men and women 
i have classified the issues raised by the honourable members into four groups 
firstly the enlargement of the thematic areas 
to answer the concern whether there is a risk that a country might concentrate all the funds on one of the categories suffering discrimination i will say that the initiative states clearly that the member states must submit one thematic category for each group that is suffering discrimination 
the second subject is flexibility and simplification 
i agree with mr leinen that the wording of the initiative is indeed very difficult and hard to understand 
that is why the services are already trying to revise the text simplify its structure and make its wording easier to grasp 
as regards the subject of flexibility we propose development partnerships and cooperation both at the geographical level where different kinds of groups would cooperate in a specific geographical area to combat discrimination in the workplace and at the thematic level where for example cooperation could take place in a specific economic sector 
this would allow member states great flexibility to tailor development cooperation to their own particular needs 
of course a prerequisite for that is cooperation between the member states and a network which will assist the exchange of experience 
finally i would like to mention technical assistance 
we are trying to arrange that there will be four categories for which funding is available 
first funding for preparation second implementation third mutual cooperation to ensure the exchange of experience and fourth technical assistance 
since there has been great involvement and concern about how technical assistance is to be provided we must say that external offices will be used 
the aim at national and european level is to establish large action groups by tender with a full description of the project for which external assistance is to be requested 
we would expect from each technical office a full description of the product so that the work can be monitored and appraised 
i want to stress that it is extremely important to promote this specific initiative as quickly as possible both for reasons of political timing and because we believe that it is important that it should begin as planned in other words we must be absolutely ready by the end of 
thank you commissioner 
i shall convey your wish that the rapporteurs should be quickly appointed for the files you mentioned to my colleagues in the bureau and to the appropriate committees 
the debate is closed 
the vote will take place tomorrow at noon 
the minutes of the sittings of thursday february and monday february have been distributed 
the minutes of february were originally distributed in brussels so perhaps this is why some members did not receive them 
are there any comments 
madam president my habit is always to be here for the opening of the part-session on monday afternoons at p.m 
yesterday it was impossible for myself and many meps to be here because the p.m 
air france flight which normally brings us here was cancelled with no explanation from the airline and we therefore arrived very late 
if air france insists on boycotting the european parliament we should take measures to prevent this occurring again 
thank you mr medina ortega 
i too wholeheartedly regret this situation 
would you be so kind as to write to me so that i have proof with which to tackle the competent authorities of both air france and the french government 
this situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly 
madam president i had the same experience as mr medina ortega yesterday 
i feel that the french authorities which have the honour of housing the european parliament in strasbourg should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connections with all the capitals of the union 
absolutely mr napolitano 
thank you 
she could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning during an anti-nuclear demonstration in glasgow 
although her identity was noted and her position as a member of the european parliament was very apparent she was still held in custody all day 
i regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the british authorities in order to ensure that this does not happen again and that mrs lucas receives an apology 
i have written to you in this respect together with my colleague mrs hautala 
thank you mr lannoye 
i have received your letter and have already contacted the british permanent representative 
i should like the vote on the community equal initiative to be postponed because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point 
i am optimistic and quite relaxed and confident about the vote we shall gain broad support for this opinion on equal 
we just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and i would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning 
madam president to follow on from the point that mr lannoye made mrs lucas was arrested just outside glasgow for protesting against the trident base at faslane 
i have a lot of sympathy with that protest 
i have however no sympathy for mrs lucas trying to hide behind her parliamentary immunity 
i have also been arrested for protesting at faslane 
i did not hide behind any immunity 
i took the punishment that came to me 
mrs lucas should do the same 
madam president i would like to comment on the request mrs stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the community initiative equal until tomorrow 
in fact this initiative was the subject of a very lively debate in committee and given that it is a major commission proposal which refers to the agreements we reached last year i consider it admissible 
we agree with mrs stenzel that the request to postpone the vote is admissible in the interests of achieving the greatest possible agreement between the groups so that parliament can express its position on this initiative with the broadest majority possible 
if not then we will proceed to the vote 
have you received any notification of any members leaving the group of the european people's party or does the austrian people's party continue to sit in that political group 
mr corbett i have not received any notification 
he should find other ways of raising his profile than expressing views on such matters here 
we are solidly with our austrian friends who have proven to be good europeans in the past 
they have our full support 
with regard to the agenda for thursday following a request made yesterday in plenary i propose extending the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance by half an hour to p.m. when the vote will take place 
the next item is the joint debate on the commission statements on its strategic objectives for the coming five years and the annual legislative programme for 
i therefore immediately give the floor to the president of the commission mr prodi 
madam president ladies and gentlemen a five-year programme is an extremely important undertaking and this is why i preferred that you be given the unabridged text of the speech which is available in four languages 
to respect my speaking time i will confine myself to referring only to the broad outlines of my programme a programme for the dawning of a new legislature and a new century when it is right and proper to see europe in a broader perspective a europe which is currently in a paradoxical situation 
let us remember that for half a century europe has provided us with peace security and freedom and a united europe has also contributed to giving us a period of unprecedented prosperity 
we are now seeing the beginning of a strong recovery which it appears may even be sustainable for a good while yet if we are prudent with our policies 
this recovery is the logical consequence of the efforts we have made but it comes at a price it follows the restructuring of public accounts in european countries which have kept inflation under control with a policy wisely intended to control costs and increase productivity in a europe that has begun a vigorous restructuring of its own industries banks and public services even though this process is not yet complete and still has a long way to go 
nevertheless despite these aspects european citizens are disappointed and concerned by unemployment which is not falling quickly enough by a europe trailing behind in technology and seemingly falling even further behind and in particular a scientific sector which is starting to lag a long way behind too by the european institutions which appear distant and do not seem to be in step with the times starting with the commission itself 
the crisis in the commission was in fact a crucial point in the relationship between europe and its citizens and the low turnout at the european elections was a worrying indication of this 
even stronger still however is the sense of insecurity the feeling of being unprepared in a new world that is moving forwards a world which is completely changing where globalisation will even end up changing our points of reference 
this is not the first time this has happened europe was once confronted with a similar transformation an explosion of its markets a change in its points of reference and a different view of the world 
i am referring to the sixteenth century when the discovery of america turned everything upside down 
some countries such as france and spain managed to meet the challenge giving rise to great nation states other countries such as italy did not meet this challenge and lost all the headway that they had accumulated during the first part of that millennium headway in science technology economic progress defence structures and military organisation philosophy and literature 
today europe is facing a similar challenge and we know that just as history has been unforgiving in the past it will not be forgiving in the present 
in this context of wholesale change and in order to prevent our nation states vanishing again in the wake of globalisation which is creating hitherto unprecedented scales and challenges europe needs to be economically strong because globalisation demands unity because every day we hear news of new agreements at world level and news of changes at european level too 
but more vital still is a europe that feels strong in the political arena 
in years past the single market and the single currency have been the pivotal point of our actions the mainstay of european life 
today the new frontiers of european integration are political frontiers common foreign and security policy justice and internal security and to a lesser extent the crucial question of the fundamental political values on which our coexistence is based 
the commission has therefore adopted the strategic programme for a programme that was immediately sent to the european parliament and with which you are already familiar so i will not go into detail about it now 
some of you may find it lacks detail but no political structure sets out detailed five-year programmes 
this is the european union not the soviet union 
our programme highlights the major points of reference the major areas for action firstly the development of new forms of governance for europe secondly extension and enlargement of the area of peace freedom and security thirdly the launch of a new stage in the growth of the economy fourthly safeguarding and improving quality of life 
these will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years 
with regard to the first area new forms of governance for europe you already know that the commission has undertaken to produce a white paper and not a full legislative text since in the light of major issues which are changing the structure of the way we interact the commission is first of all preparing for a debate we will subsequently discuss the content with you this will give rise to a policy document and finally a legislative document 
this is an effective transparent way to proceed and involve all the european institutions and the citizens of europe 
this white paper is a response to the challenges that enlargement is forcing on us an enlargement that is forcing us to rethink the workings of all our institutions rethink our very policies all our policies and above all rethink what we must continue to do at union level when the member states number or and what will be the best thing to do at individual state level at regional level and at local government level 
but it is not only enlargement that is urging us towards this rethink as i said a few moments ago it is also economic and political globalisation itself 
we must govern europe in such a way as to make us more efficient to bring us closer to the citizens and to encourage everyone to get involved starting with the important issue of the involvement of women 
this is a field where europe has nevertheless always been in the vanguard 
we therefore need to reflect on this at length and with an open mind and all the institutions commission parliament council will have to consider their own roles and their own policies 
we shall therefore get straight back to work on this white paper although in order to finish it we shall have to wait for the results of the intergovernmental conference and it will therefore not be ready until spring 
it will not be a philosophical paper but a practical paper full of focused proposals 
we the commission are the first to know that we must have a total rethink and we shall therefore do two things we are and will continue to be fully committed to internal reform and we shall rethink our policies in detail 
i have asked all the commissioners and i shall ask them once again in a still more analytical way to pinpoint all the activities that we can forgo 
the commission must define what its fundamental activities are what it must concentrate on and shed its non-essential activities thereby freeing up new resources and ensuring a more correct and co-operative relationship with individual countries regions and local communities 
so we shall be freeing up new resources but i fear and i want to state this before parliament the time will come when these new resources that we are already freeing up will in turn be insufficient in terms of allowing us to address our new tasks i am thinking of enlargement the new sector of justice and home affairs health issues and environmental matters 
when that time comes when we have used up all our resources i shall not hesitate to come here before you to request further resources but what i am saying now is that if we are not given these necessary resources we shall have to refuse to take on any new duties because the available resources will not be commensurate with the new tasks that we will be taking on 
as for internal reform you well know how committed my commission has been to this since day one 
i know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the commission does not undertake vigorous and comprehensive internal reform if it does not become more efficient if it does not increase efficiency in all sectors starting with the sector in which the worst backlogs have built up in the past external aid 
providing aid rapidly when it is needed saves human lives in many cases providing it late is worse than not providing it at all 
when i speak about external aid my thoughts immediately turn to the balkans 
there is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems 
this is the new element that we must help to bring to the balkans 
we must increase our efficiency in this area 
we must reopen the danube to boats 
it is contradictory to offer aid to romania and bulgaria yet leave these countries unable to harness their greatest resource 
we must decontaminate the river and in view of this over the next few days the commissioner responsible for the environment will be putting forward specific plans to monitor this serious problem 
we have done a lot in the balkans the new european reconstruction agency for kosovo the balkans task force and new regulations to speed up procedures 
nevertheless we definitely have to do more 
we must liberalise trade within the region and between the region and the european union we must contribute to building infrastructural links that will end its centuries-old isolation we must intensify efforts to build a democratic pluralist society in these countries with institutions public structures police forces and a structured civil society but above all we must press these countries to work together in the context of a united region as regards both politics and the economy 
if we do not do this we shall have failed in our duty 
remember that the marshall plan was not effective simply because of the scale of its resources it was even more effective because it made us europeans work together towards a new horizon it gave us a fresh outlook in terms of our politics and our economy 
this is what we need to do for the balkans 
europe must prove in the balkans and the rest of the world its ability to extend the area of security peace and freedom and its ability to take a leading role on the international stage 
we are clearly once again returning to enlargement which must be put into practice in tandem with the extension of the area of security peace and freedom 
we have made many promises in this regard but i believe we shall succeed in keeping our promises even though we have a very delicate path to tread 
indeed enlargement which will be with us for our five years in office and beyond i am referring to the aspirations of applicant countries must hinge on concrete objective criteria and also on reassuring public opinion in the countries involved and to an even greater degree public opinion in our own member states 
there will be friendship calm openness but also a certain strictness in the enlargement process 
i repeat we must reassure public opinion in those countries that wish to join but we need to provide public opinion in our own member states with even greater reassurance 
our responsibilities do not stop at enlargement or at the balkans 
there are certain other key issues relations with ukraine relations with russia relations with neighbouring countries and more importantly the important question of relations with the southern mediterranean which will be a crucial point for european history and for security and peace in europe for future generations 
in this regard we have a responsibility towards the whole of africa 
in recent times africa has raised hopes and has received offers of help but nothing tangible has yet been achieved 
in recent years in africa we have not seen a shift from totalitarian regimes to democracy but quite the contrary a shift from democracy to totalitarian regimes 
africa is for us a worrying topic for discussion 
we therefore have another duty at international level which has already been proposed by the commissioner responsible for trade the undertaking to relaunch the millennium round and to take on some fundamental problems affecting the poorest countries not just in terms of writing off debts but also via the unilateral opening-up to trade with the poorest countries in the world with a great deal of willingness on our part which we had already proposed prior to seattle but which we could not put into practice 
we should remember that we the european union are a union of minorities we are all a minority within europe 
there are concerns even within the fifteen concerns which may even surface again in the next decade 
i am referring to the situation in austria where the commission has remained true to its role being duty-bound to work towards the cohesion of the union but also the unwavering guardian of the treaties ready to punish every minor breach of the principles of democracy law and respect for minorities 
some people have criticised me over the congratulatory message i sent to chancellor schüssel 
my message to you is do not take the necessary and proper courtesies of form to mean that i have been less firm in the content 
reread the letter the reference to the fundamental values of the union is taken and this is more than mere coincidence from article of the treaty i repeat article of the treaty 
i would also ask you whether you believe that any other european head of government has ever been reminded of these principles by the commission when they were elected 
this is what we wish to do maintain our role as a supranational structure maintain the role conferred on us by the treaties but also be unwavering on principles and make judgements based on facts 
last november the commission tabled a proposal for an anti-racism directive 
i would ask the council to adopt it swiftly and i would ask parliament to help us with this action which will further strengthen the fundamental bases of our social cohesion 
i will quickly conclude by mentioning the last two points of our programme the economy and quality of life 
i have already talked about the economy we well know which basic ingredients will set europe on the path towards a lasting recovery which will in turn create more jobs 
we must continue to keep inflation under control proceed with liberalisation ensure more competition encourage the dissemination of information technology and all new technologies push forward with science and push back scientific boundaries and develop an appetite for being at the cutting edge of science 
the forthcoming lisbon summit on these issues dissemination of technology employment will be a decisive summit 
it has taken four years for us to be in a position to hold a summit of this kind 
we are at last holding it and cannot let this opportunity slip through our fingers 
finally our last commitment is to improve quality of life 
we have opened this chapter with the white paper on food safety we now need to make significant headway in the environment sector 
the erika oil slick and the contamination of the danube demonstrates the pressing need for european scale intervention to safeguard the environment 
the time has come to discuss and then establish a body for emergency civil protection in europe 
all too often we find ourselves calling for this after a disaster has occurred 
i think it would be appropriate to begin thinking about these things before disasters happen 
these are the challenges that we the commission but also all the other european institutions are facing 
how will we judge ladies and gentlemen madam president the five years of our mandate 
how are we going to assess the results of these five years 
i do not know but one benchmark we could certainly use is the challenge we must take up together 
let us take a very simple parameter turnout at the next european elections 
if it is higher than at the previous elections it will mean that we have successfully met our challenge 
madam president ladies and gentlemen we are faced with all these major political challenges but precisely because of the recovery that is now underway we are also faced with major opportunities 
this ladies and gentlemen could be the decade of europe 
indeed i would say that this must be the decade of europe 
we also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document 
and we welcome the broad outlines of the speech which president prodi has just given 
we read in the conclusions in the document that the five-year term of office of the prodi commission will be a time of major changes 
europe will press ahead with integration at the same time the union will start an enlargement process which will in the end reunite our continent 
a demanding ambitious perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success mr president of the commission 
however we consider that the present is the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present 
i say that in all earnestness and i have chosen my words carefully 
i refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the european union 
we in the european union are one community 
we belong together even when there are problems 
now is not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unifying europe 
mr president of the commission you have represented and defended the european parliament time and again over recent weeks 
you have seen yourself as the guardian of the treaties and that is indeed your role 
for that and for the letter to the federal chancellor of the republic of austria which you mentioned we expressly respect acknowledge and support you 
mr president of the commission our objectives are one and the same we want a strong europe in the twenty-first century a democratic europe which is able to act 
a europe which defends its values of human dignity and democratic rule of law both internally and to the outside world and at the same time looks after its global interests with dignity patience and convincing self-confidence 
globalisation gives us the chance to shape the world which is becoming smaller and smaller as a world of peaceful competition and solidarity 
seen in this light globalisation is more of an opportunity than a danger more of a coming together than a segregation more mutual enrichment than separation 
but we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together as europeans 
globalisation is not only an economic process it is also a cultural process which is why we say we want partnership in the world we do not want the clash of civilisations which many are predicting we want partnership a meeting exchange and peace 
but we also say we want to defend this european community of tolerance which is why a common foreign security and defence policy is so important 
negotiations with six central european countries are starting today bringing the european family a step closer together 
we agree with what you said about the barcelona process 
all the countries in the mediterranean area must acknowledge human dignity democracy and the rule of law 
we therefore take the uncompromising view that we must maintain a resolute and consistent stability pact 
we need structural reforms in the european economy 
most importantly we need to restore a european economy in which performance pays and people can work as entrepreneurs 
we too want to help put europe on its feet 
you spoke in your paper of decentralisation and subsidiarity 
we support that 
the nations regions towns and communities of europe will be preserved 
however there is a current trend the fauna flora habitat directive was quoted as an example which in my country at least creates the impression that associations are bypassing national and regional institutions and submitting programmes to brussels and that brussels is then making decisions affecting the property of countless agricultural holdings in the countries of the european union 
i merely mention it as an example of where we must take care and where i would recommend that we try to achieve more legal security in the future 
if you are persuasive in your actions we all reap the benefits 
in this respect we wish you every success 
if we have the merest suspicion that you are failing to safeguard the law of the european union and at present we have no cause for complaint on the contrary we acknowledge that this is not the case but if european law is infringed then we shall fight any such infringement uncompromisingly precisely because peace in the european union is founded on this law 
we must preserve this law and peace in the european union if we are to be able to go forth as peacemakers in the world 
firstly this is welcome because it explains to our fellow citizens what we are intending to do and what we are already doing 
we must also express our regret at the current situation and try to improve on it for the future 
we have taken almost eleven months president prodi was nominated at the berlin summit in march last year to establish a legislative programme 
we are recovering from a crisis 
however i believe that in the future it would be appropriate for the investiture of the next commission to coincide with the presentation of a legislative programme 
we are breaking new ground and doing so in complex circumstances 
president prodi began his speech by talking of a paradoxical situation a paradox in the european union and also throughout the world we are at the dawn of a new secular millennium dominated by the web of the internet and the sorcery of biotechnological advance and we are living through a genuine change of epoch 
what we need here is good government madam president 
since we are recovering from a very complex crisis we must try to enhance our institutions and give them substance 
i would like to remind the house of something which we often forget and that is that the investiture of the prodi commission last september received wide support 
in our opinion this demonstrates that the majority of us are in favour of progress and in favour of europe 
i would like to point out that within this broad consensus there were some groups which said that the majority of parliament should form an opposition to the majority of the council 
it is precisely this which in a sense is hindering the important process of developing codecision within the legislative programme 
i am pointing this out because i believe that our support for the commission also has to lead to continuity in the work carried out throughout the legislature 
on the other hand we are witnessing the birth of a political europe which entails a collection of shared values which we all agree upon and a european union at the service of the citizens 
with regard to the events of recent days i would like to say and i am saying this on the day and the week that the intergovernmental conference is starting we have to place far more value and fundamental emphasis upon the charter on fundamental rights which given what we have said about the austrian crisis i believe should be fully included in the treaties 
i have absolutely no doubt about this and i believe it is an essential point 
in this regard madam president i would like to say that we should remain aware and watch our language 
last week the new minister for finance of the austrian coalition described the austrian parliament as a farce and a theatre 
those of us who have had to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictatorships with cardboard governments 
there can be no democracy without a living parliament 
i believe that this type of language is extremely dangerous and i would like to condemn it here and now 
with regard to the four great priorities which president prodi systematically refers to and with regard to his analysis of the challenges facing us i would say that we are very much in agreement 
nevertheless i would point out to the commission that as far as the socialist group is concerned there has been a change of priorities 
when speaking of the commitment to full employment we have to bear in mind that these days full employment does not mean what it meant in the era of beveridge at the end of the second world war that is to say employment for the male head of the household 
this means prioritising sex equality the adaptation of the social model and above all an unequivocal fight against populism whenever our economic and social cohesion is under threat 
this must also be a main priority in the work of the commission 
it must be complemented with a forthright fight against racism and intolerance so that we may come to recognise in practice the evolution of a union which has become a magnet for the rest of the world and an immigration zone given its prosperity and seasonal demographics 
i believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue 
in this respect i would also add another element which is economic government given the single currency and i believe this is inescapable 
this is another question on which the commission must make progress 
does the commission think that there will be never be any revision 
the issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential 
with regard to governance in general i believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms 
i would like to remind you of one thing it is dangerous to rethink the entire governance of the european union from here 
i would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity 
if we are capable of defining what our area of governance is i think that would be very positive 
in all other areas i believe that subsidiarity is also relevant to this discussion 
not only should the commission discuss this but also our states our parliaments and our civil society 
it appears that there is agreement and support with regard to the prioritisation of south-east europe with regard to enlargement and as i have said already with regard to the process of integration and the strengthening of the euro-mediterranean programme and our ability to prevent conflicts as well as an issue which we seldom talk about the north-south challenge 
we must not forget africa a continent which has been forsaken not only by god but also by europe nor our important contribution to cooperating with development 
it means the reform of the united nations and the international financial institutions for which europe has an enormous responsibility 
above all madam president and here i will end we must be able to express this in plain language clearly by changing to some extent the jargon which we use because we cannot ask the europeans who are living through profound changes to take part and show enthusiasm towards us if we continue to use a form of language which they find completely inaccessible 
this is a fundamental way to increase and strengthen their confidence in us 
i hope this will be demonstrated when we hold the next european elections 
mr president of the commission may i say to you on behalf of my group that we very much support the point of departure the core of the analysis and the strategy that you bring to this house today that is that the stakes now are irrefutably political 
they are political because we are moving on 
even though we have not yet finished constructing all the economic building blocks we are moving on from that kind of functionalist building of europe to a much more challenging political perspective 
the challenge of enlargement is political 
the challenge of creating an area of justice and home affairs of dealing with asylum and immigration and crime is very political 
the challenge of a common foreign security and defence policy is very political 
because it is political it is more complex 
because it is political it is more sovereignty-sensitive 
because it is more sovereignty-sensitive it is more voter-and citizen-sensitive 
we need therefore to find a way forward towards these political ends and objectives to address not merely the scepticism but the greatest enemy the apathy which you identify 
the means of achieving this are difficult but they are real 
i applaud your view that we need more synergy between our institutions not just between commission and parliament but also between these and the council to underscore the extent of the political challenge 
we need more dialogue not just with each other but also with civil society 
we need more explanation of what europe is about 
we need to be able to confront fears and anxieties because in many instances the greatest fear is fear itself 
perhaps with more dialogue and explanation we can overcome some of that 
my group is especially attracted to the creative possibilities you signal in regard to the prospect of a white paper next spring addressing the issue of governance 
as we look at the europe of networking which you describe it is very important that europe concentrates on its core business that we have the courage to suggest areas where europe may perhaps stand back 
that could convince people that europe in its governance is not something run exclusively from brussels which concentrates and soaks up more powers more decisions more authority 
that is the political core of the challenge and i think you have identified it well before this house today 
for my group enlargement is the first priority against which all the other possibilities for reform must be measured be they governance be they the intergovernmental conference be they reform of the institutions 
we see enlargement as a process of partnership not a process of them and us 
we see enlargement as a positive sum gain for member and candidate states 
i suggest to the commission as a repository of an enormous amount of detailed information on enlargement to present a document that explains the value of enlargement not just in budgetary and financial terms but in a broader sense a document like the cecchini report before the single act that explains to people in a way which engages them in the debate that this is the grand historic challenge facing europe today 
we need to be able to prepare that ground carefully 
on south-eastern europe i agree with your view that we measure political institutions through their achievements 
in the lifetime of this commission and this parliament we must succeed in the task of winning the difficult and uneasy peace in south-eastern europe 
we applaud the stabilisation and association agreements but we would like to see more 
we will publish this material and bring it forward in the debate on the swoboda report later this week 
the strategic paper emphasises the global role of the european union 
our central aim must be to give the union a weight in global affairs commensurate with its weight in terms of aid trade and finance 
at the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institutions will develop internationally by its end and notably where we fit into international monetary bodies where we fit into un agencies and so on 
we need to open that debate 
in conclusion this morning the day after st valentine's day the newspapers are saying that your honeymoon period is over 
i do not know whether you are a romantic or not mr prodi 
perhaps this is a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning 
however we in the liberal group welcome this because it means we are now settling down to business 
that is the way it should be 
regarding the many adjectival descriptions of europe you addressed in your speech an energetic europe an enterprising europe a europe that has a human face and is inclusive let me in a word dear to the heart of my liberal colleagues give in one adjective one description of the kind of europe we want to see in your plan for governance an enabling europe 
madam president mr president of the commission i greatly admire the openness with which you admit that the european union must change fundamentally 
you gave consideration to important questions of principle in your programme 
i believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issues alongside the day-to-day ones 
at the same time however it has to be said that unfortunately your programme reminds me in many ways of a party manifesto 
there are a lot of good intentions in it but it very much lacks concrete proposals concerning how this can all be achieved 
as in any other party manifesto it is full of contradictions 
i would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them 
first let me speak about the economy and social development 
we have to be able to think hard about how we can coordinate the aim of competitiveness with the aim of full employment that is what was mentioned in your programme 
should we at long last be drafting convergence criteria in which as you in fact hint at in this programme the aim would be that unemployment in no member state should be higher than say the three most successful countries in this matter 
ecological tax reform is what my group would like to stress the importance of because we can only create employment and sustainable development by changing our taxation structure 
but unfortunately as we all know this is an area where the european union is totally unable to act 
do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference 
the eu can only achieve authority in the fact that it focuses on tasks that individual countries cannot attend to alone 
in this respect parliament will definitely defend along with yourselves the importance of supranational decision-making 
one contradiction within your programme relates to globalisation 
however please learn from the events of seattle we have to be able to combine the freedom in world trade on the one hand with all those values of human importance that we wish to defend on the other 
you must embark on a dialogue with the international community 
do please try to make the international organisations democratic 
the european union could be critically important in a process in which the united nations and the wto really do become subject to democratic monitoring 
we can submit motions for this together with you 
finally i consider it a very positive sign that you speak so often about the civil society although unfortunately this is another contradiction 
you ought to also be able to draw conclusions at the igc 
we have to table motions proposing that our citizens might really have a direct impact on decision-making 
what you just said is absolutely true people want more engaged democracy 
in my opinion this is the only way if we want to gain the approval of the people with regard to europe and their interest in europe too 
the main merit of the text of this communication is therefore the fact that it exists 
we are also pleased to see certain statements and intentions which it contains and which mr prodi has just underlined and in some cases usefully clarified 
this must be one of our absolute priorities 
we do need to rethink many aspects of current community policy if the important and difficult project of enlargement is to be a success 
there are plenty of areas for serious discussion 
we will carefully study the planned white papers and will participate constructively in the work begun or promised 
it is in this spirit that i have three criticisms to make 
the perfect illustration of this crippling flaw lies in the opening sentence of the commission communication 
a more balanced and more rigorous diagnosis would be welcome in my view 
similarly the idea that the euro has fostered a consensus on wage moderation is not really borne out by the repeated nervous orders issued by the european central bank to the trade unions which are deemed to be too demanding 
my second criticism follows on from the first 
this extreme difficulty in seeing the contradictions of the current situation and where necessary confronting these is seriously limiting the will duly confirmed by mr prodi to grant public demands 
my third criticism stems from the first two 
the weakness of the analysis and the obstacles to the necessary changes have resulted in a project whose scope is severely limited by an overabundance of generalisations a rather indecisive approach and therefore a lack of impetus 
but all is not lost 
this is a starting point and we have five years to succeed provided that the political will exists and is expressed with sufficient force and clarity 
my group is fully intent on helping with this work 
madam president reforming and democratising the institutions of the european union are central to the historic and moral challenge of the enlargement process 
this was the opening statement of commission president prodi when he presented the strategic objectives of the european commission for the next five years 
we await the white paper on the governance of the european union dealing with the issue of balance between member states' governments and the european union institutions which is to be published this summer 
on this specific point i think it is important that we address the reform of the internal decision-making procedures of the commission 
the commission in its proposals to the forthcoming intergovernmental conference has indicated that its preference lies in seeing smaller member states lose their automatic right to nominate a member of the european commission 
this is a scenario whereby the european union has a membership of over member states 
i do not want to see a two-tier european union built 
i believe this would fly in the face of the spirit and objective of the treaty of rome and all subsequent treaties 
there must be equality in terms of national representation within the commission and within all the other european institutions 
i would like to remind those who seek to eliminate the right of small member states to nominate a european commissioner that the united states of america gives smaller states the same recognition as larger states in the united states senate 
more or less each of the states in the us has two elected positions in the united states senate regardless of its population 
any future reforms of the european union treaties will require a referendum to be held in my country 
undoubtedly reform of the european council is also going to be included in this white paper on the governance of the european union which will be published this summer 
once again there are special areas of policy-making which should be left to the domain of the national member states 
i do not believe that there is broad support in europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting on taxation justice and home affairs and foreign affairs at european union level 
at present under article of the treaty of rome decisions taken at eu level concerning tax changes must be by unanimity 
i believe that this proposal should remain as a common european taxation code would diminish rather than enhance the workings of the european union 
i support the enlargement of the european union 
i support institutional changes so as to ensure that enlargement of the union takes place in a streamlined and structured manner 
however we must remember that the public opinion of million people in the european union is a vital factor in changing the eu treaties 
changes should not be brought about too quickly and cannot be too sweeping otherwise public opinion will make ratification of any future european union treaty very difficult indeed 
madam president i am speaking on behalf of the italian radical members 
president of the commission a short while ago you said that no political structure sets out five-year plans 
so whether this is to be a government programme or a potential programme the breakdown of the document you distributed to us and of the accompanying speech is not much more than a list of good intentions or rather a list of issues on the table 
in this house in the past large-scale debates have taken place on major strategic options which the commission under its power of initiative launched not as experiments but as proposals which then made varying degrees of progress but in any case did contribute to the integration and development of the european union 
in this case mr prodi we certainly have a kind of ten commandments a whole raft of issues are listed but if i may say so we are left with the impression that the commission is afraid to make any decision regarding what needs to be done about any of these points 
there was only one point that you really stressed too much in my opinion and that was that it looks almost as if the highest priority task that you are setting yourself is to cease unnecessary activities 
we should be careful though mr prodi because we had a crisis of confidence in the previous commission and backed this commission at least a parliamentary majority backed this commission precisely because first and foremost the reform of the commission would bring consolidation a new identity and a new awareness of being guided by a firm hand 
let us consider the scenario whereby the commission not believing itself to be equal to the task wishes or proposes to shed for example its powers to implement common policies which it is nevertheless accorded by the treaty 
what do we expect from a government in any case 
what do we ask of this structure the european community which is so to speak ambiguous and unique 
it is right for joint resources to be controlled supranationally and not to be delegated to the member states or the taos as has been the case in the past 
it seems that you are proposing the same old menu but with more unsatisfactory implications restricting the commission so you say to the task of drawing up a few white papers as you proposed 
my fear even if you shake your head mr prodi is that this will translate into what some countries have thought for years that the commission should be a simple secretariat for the council of ministers 
if this is the role that the commission intends to play over the next five years we federalists are convinced we are certain that this is not the right path to take and we shall send for you and judge what the commission intends to do in this regard 
the reform is important but if it aggravates the situation reduces or weakens the supranational powers of the commission then the structure of european integration as planned by the founding fathers for the european commission will be at risk 
as for the other points mr prodi i will take economic and social policy as an example the european social model is certainly experiencing a major crisis and it is certainly not coincidental that unemployment tops the list of problems that none of our policies has managed to resolve but it is not certain that it can be resolved by going through a list of problems that we have discussed in the past without having a clear idea or proposal which takes note of the fact that europe contains economies that are growing at some of the most sustainable rates and that it is not by chance that these are the economies which have made labour market flexibility and enterprise their prime objective 
if we continue to get bogged down with proposals that have given extremely poor results so far i do not know what we or the commission will be able to do 
the same goes for enlargement as an end in itself without it being linked to a reform to make the european union and its structures much more efficient and to proposals that the commission could have made at the igc 
mr prodi there is one positive thing that i would like to say to you perhaps contrary to the opinion of some members regarding the telegram that you sent to the austrian government 
we approve of your position on this you did well not to isolate that country any further 
in any case we shall see what specific steps transpire when the time comes for practical action 
mr prodi i repeat that this is in our opinion a slightly short-sighted view 
above all it lacks drive in the sectors i have mentioned for example as regards the balkans 
can we really continue to leave the balkans out of the enlargement process disregarding the fact that croatia macedonia and other countries also have the right to a place in this house that is open to all 
like yourself he promised less and better but mr santer finished up by having delivered much more and much worse and i do not believe that you either can deliver the goods you promise 
you talk about decentralisation but practise centralisation 
the legislative programme is in fact a litany of subjects over which the people are to be deprived of influence and in connection with which mr prodi you are to take influence away from the people even on social questions 
you talk about greater transparency but produce proposals which would lead to documents which at present are available for public inspection being locked away 
your commission consists of the only people in the eu who can propose that the quantity of legislation should be reduced 
local politicians cannot do that once legislation has been passed in brussels 
the legislative programme from the commission ought at least therefore to be accompanied by as long a list of tasks which are to be referred back to the member states and to the processes of popular democracy 
otherwise the number of laws produced in brussels will just keep on growing 
we have passed laws and as many amendments and the applicant states have had documents sent to them which as debated by the polish parliament fill sides of paper 
even by this stage that is already too many by far 
brussels should make decisions on fewer matters and hand over more decisions to the people the regions and the member states 
the only decisions which should remain with brussels are those concerning cross-border issues which the national parliaments can no longer legislate on effectively 
what is more the work carried out in brussels should be of a much higher quality and be completely transparent so that people might at least have some small sense of owning the process now that mr prodi and his predecessor have taken their autonomy away from them 
what he envisaged was what he called a small practical secretariat 
that is not what mr prodi is president of today 
madam president this morning the commission president mr prodi has set out ambitious goals for the european union for the next five years laudable aims indeed to make a strong and effective european presence felt in the world succeeding with enlargement meeting the challenge of selling e-europe introducing better principles of governance 
we accept that europeans particularly the younger generation need to be given a broad perspective of where europe will be in the years ahead 
but how are we to succeed when the resources available are limited and the credibility of our institutions is not very high 
we need to match this vision with reality 
here there are three elements i would like to contribute 
firstly we need a successful european economy 
we must ensure that unemployment rates continue to go down across europe confirm the trend in privatisation and deregulation encourage the insertion of information technology and knowledge of the internet show that e-europe is a good initiative 
but we must avoid lurching back into the old-style regulation stifling individual initiative and enterprise 
we must not fear globalisation but we must also make sure that we understand its political impact in the network society 
without a successful european economy we cannot meet the challenges ahead particularly of enlargement 
secondly we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary subsidiarity 
doing less but better a central plank of the last commission needs to be the aim of this commission too 
we will be looking at this closely when we come to the annual programmes of proposed legislation 
mr bonde was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year of proposals and recommendations which seems to go in a different direction 
we must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes 
lastly we need to ensure that there is proper genuine reform of the european commission 
yes the commission guardian of the treaties is meant to be an independent body but it also has to be accountable to european citizens through our parliament 
the information problem which mr bonde just referred to is treated like a straw in the wind with the commission seeming to restrict information to us as citizens and as parliamentarians although we have the right to it under the treaties 
the commission is not in fact today a european government 
the commission does not reflect the majority in this particular parliament 
we in parliament have a major role to play in the shaping of governance in europe 
this governance therefore needs to be a sensitive governance so that we can actually work together and understand that each of the institutions in the european union has its relevant role to play 
therefore we need to have credibility coherence and confidence that in working together we can restore the image of the european union to our citizens 
madam president mr president of the commission numerous steps have been taken in the past to strengthen the european union from the euro to resolutions on a common security policy even to the response by the the commission and parliament to the new coalition in austria 
i fully endorse the philosophy and the principles behind these decisions 
nonetheless i agree with you mr president of the commission that many more steps to strengthen the european union will be needed in the future because the european union is not strong enough either to master the huge inevitable task of enlargement or to control current and potential movements which to put it mildly have an ambivalent attitude towards european values of democracy and tolerance and the desire to integrate all the people on our continent 
that does not apply to austria alone 
the union professes its faith in its fundamental values in the treaty of amsterdam and the institutions of the eu confirmed this faith once again when the new coalition was formed in austria 
however the full potential of these values will only be realised if they are set out in comprehensive detail in and form part of the treaty and in the final analysis represent legal claims on the part of individual citizens 
when it comes down to it articles and of the treaty are not enough 
in this sense the commission must insist and i should like to endorse and confirm this here that the new charter of fundamental rights become part of the treaty and create binding enforceable rights 
in this sense the commission must insist on building up the common area of freedom security and justice and in this sense i disagree with the last two speakers 
only reasonable feasible and humane principles of immigration and asylum law can counter the irrational misleading and demagogic allegations of the extreme right 
but and i would like to stress this this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy to promote employment and prevent social exclusion because unemployment marginalisation and growing inequality are the best breeding grounds for anti-european nationalistic actions and reactions 
in this respect mr president of the commission i too should like to address the issue of globalisation which you speculated on and how it is perceived by large segments of the population 
the feeling of being at the mercy of others of lacking in influence and of having no protection from the state leads in the best case scenario to a lack of interest in politics and a refusal to vote as in the european elections and in the worst case scenario to extremist voting patterns 
the union like everyone else has not yet understood how to present the eu to the citizens of the eu as a means of protection against the negative effects of globalisation 
we are in the process of building a house but too few of our citizens really feel at home in our house 
what we need are not just reforms of the world trade organisation and the economic architecture and significantly the president of the commission forgot to mention the reform of the financial institutions and international financial architecture we also need confidence-building measures for our citizens who rightly expect help and support from and in the eu with the inevitable and painful process of adapting to new global circumstances 
you yourself mr president spoke of a model of which unfortunately there is little mention in the document 
you said that we must offer our citizens a model of economic social cultural and ecological development both internally and towards the outside world which differs from other models including the us model 
in this sense the usa is not only our partner it is also our competitor not our opponent our competitor and we must fight to see which of us offers our citizens the best model 
i hope that what we have said so clearly and vehemently here today will also be reinforced in the commission documents 
madam president mr president of the commission the greatest legacy which your commission could pass on to the european union would be to help resettle and redistribute the increasingly jumbled and confused powers and competences of the commission and perhaps of the union itself 
you have made a bold start by rightly emphasising the need to focus on so-called core tasks 
that as you have said yourself today means that you must also identify tasks policies and programmes which are peripheral or irrelevant to the commission's main vocation 
many existing european union policies and programmes may simply have passed their sell-by date or have been proved unwieldy or ineffective when administered at european level 
the challenge now is to have the courage to devolve as many non-core tasks as possible back to lower levels of national regional and local government 
if we are to succeed in persuading a sceptical european public of the merits of further european integration we must be able to demonstrate that we are as active in the devolution of unwarranted eu powers as we are in the evolution of new eu powers 
we must not allow the critics of european integration to claim as they presently do with some justification as we have just heard from mr bonde that the increase in eu responsibilities is a one-way street only 
it must be shown to be a two-way process in which existing eu policies and programmes which are not clearly justified on the grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality are devolved and repealed 
if you are able to match these aspirations with actions in the years ahead you will be making an unprecedented contribution to the future of the european union as a whole and as we have heard today you will enjoy widespread support in this european parliament 
i am aware of the limitations of the exercise given that we have to work within the current treaty and are therefore restricted by its operational rules 
i am thinking in this respect of the important issue of taxation which i am not however going to talk about 
rather i want to start by welcoming certain proposals which you have made in this programme for 
these include all the proposals on food safety which are ambitious and important and those on maritime safety which are particularly important given the two oil slicks which have affected the coast of brittany and turkey 
the commission should react quickly in this respect 
however on other issues the proposals could be more ambitious and faster acting 
i have some positive suggestions to make particularly on the social area the environment and the follow-up to seattle 
firstly you have said that the citizens of europe must be reconciled with the institutions 
this is self-evident and it is therefore essential to find out their main concerns 
for example in the social area it is not enough to announce a communication on a programme of social action 
we must move faster 
you must submit a new social action programme to us by the end of the year 
the issue of company closures and mass redundancies is one which has been and still is very firmly in the news 
we are working on the basis of a directive whose limitations have been clearly demonstrated 
i therefore propose that this should be reviewed in order to produce a directive which is more effective in protecting employment and also in imposing penalties on those who do not comply 
on the environment you have announced a proposal for a decision on a sixth action programme on the environment 
this is all very well but it seems that the text to be proposed will not contain any specific objectives or a timetable for implementation 
perhaps you can correct me on this 
i personally feel that it is essential to have precise objectives and a proper timetable for implementation 
in terms of civil liability for the environment it is right that we finally have a white paper 
however parliament did ask for a legislative initiative six years ago 
the white paper clearly foreshadows this legislation but for when 
you must realise that this process needs to be accelerated 
finally after kyoto we should be able to rapidly produce precise proposals 
finally on the subject of the wto the idea of relaunching a new global round is not necessarily bad 
however in the first place the commission should make proposals on changing the operational rules of the wto 
the commission has a role both within the eu and throughout the world 
madam president you spoke about fundamental political values and one of the fundamental political values even more important than democracy is respect for others 
we therefore feel that you acted correctly in sending a message and that perhaps those who protested about it are still feeling the effects of bolshevism or nazism 
democracy means dialogue with others and making others realise when they are wrong but also listening to their explanations 
enlargement and alleanza nazionale has been repeating this for ten years in this house must not mean dilution that is it must not entail more risks 
the applicant countries' hopes are at least as important as the hopes of our current fellow citizens who are beginning to feel bitterly disappointed by the way europe works as it is not resolving the most serious problems 
we therefore need to be strict in the enlargement process and respect those agreements which should it be necessary need to be redrafted with regard to certain fundamental issues such as the environmental disaster that has occurred in romania reaching as far as belgrade but above all the continuing spread of apathy as regards major security issues 
even today we do not have definite answers regarding the monitoring of the nuclear power stations in the eastern republics 
we therefore need resources available to spend before proceeding to enlargement so that we can at last establish a european monitoring body responsible for monitoring quality of life and living conditions with the aim of creating a new world where such tragedies will no longer occur 
i would also like to say a few words on africa madam president 
the third and fourth worlds have been abandoned just one dollar one and a half euro would be enough to save a great many children 
europe which is so democratic so progressive does not speak out or take these tragic problems on board while half of africa is dying of aids and other diseases 
one final remark regarding the internet and globalisation 
globalisation of the economy must not be reduced to product and quality certification just as the globalisation of politics must not come to mean levelling of values or dampening of hopes and enthusiasm 
the peoples which do not participate and gradually grow more distant will leave the way open for an oligarchy that will take power and leave control in the hands of a few 
as for the internet europe has finally found the courage to say that we need rules 
on a personal note please allow me at this time to congratulate the pirates who by acting the way they are are forcing the world to reflect on the only system which is currently unregulated 
we live in a world of rules and regulations let us regulate the internet too and give our fellow citizens rules and hope for the future 
madam president as a padanian taxpayer i have already experienced the vice-like grip of the taxman and former prime minister of italy mr prodi since padania is liable to italy for its taxes as well 
listening to him just now i was concerned when he mentioned new resources something that readily translates as additional taxation in view inter alia of enlargement that is the entry of new states into the union 
but why do they not buy their own entrance ticket 
my padanian electorate who thanks to mr prodi have already paid what in italy is known as the european tax repaid only in part have absolutely no intention thanks once again to mr prodi of paying another tax for someone else 
madam president mr president of the commission members of the commission five months after its coming into office the commission committed to paper the direction in which it aims to steer the european union 
the ensuing document is both ambitious and bombastic 
is it not rather melodramatic to say that the world looks up to europe 
moreover europe as a continent is a great deal more than just the fifteen eu member states 
it is not rather ambitious to ensure peace democracy and human rights in the whole of europe no less 
i am particularly intrigued by how the commission considers bringing this about 
does the european integration model as a rich source for global administration imply the export of a large-scale perspective and concentration of power 
according to the commission external policy can succeed provided everyone knows exactly who is in charge 
so who is this then 
the commission as a whole its president perhaps the council 
you stated that the new european government requires strong institutions while the commission wants to focus at the same time on its core tasks 
we could not agree more with the latter 
it is high time that institutions restricted their scope to actual cross-border issues and stopped decking out the european cart with powers which they are taking away from national authorities 
the document mentions common values on different occasions 
unfortunately i find the reference to the relevant standards to be lacking 
this raises the question as to what these standards and values are based on 
in the tradition of our continent this realisation is an important one which merits recognition 
madam president i would like to congratulate mr prodi and the commission on their government policy statement 
i very much agree with the gist of the document 
i also share the view of mr prodi and the commission that in a number of areas there is a need for more europe and more integration and rightly so 
areas such as security the world trade conference food safety but also the new economy require more action therefore from the european commission 
it will be a challenge to find a way of bringing the member states the council the european parliament the national parliaments the commission and all kinds of other agents into line 
clear priorities focus and above all communication with society to inform them of what we are up to are the key goals 
that requires from the commission with a view to subsidiarity concrete plans which we would like to see implemented in the forthcoming programmes 
there is in itself nothing wrong with emphasising the core functions and i applaud the fact that the commission would like to assume a better more prominent role in order to develop policy ideas and political initiatives 
take the telecom sector for example 
although we have drafted a large number of directives at the end of the day we still have different markets and the member states still implement the directives differently 
and where implementation is concerned the commission needs to ensure that our political wishes are also implemented in practice 
looking at foreign policy madam president i very much like the ambition that the european union should have as much political as economic say at world level 
but then i wonder if there is talk of a real common policy of a system of crisis prevention and crisis control at community level where are the actual proposals then 
indeed at the end of the day we need these in order to verify whether we can realise our objectives in this area 
mr prodi was right in devoting a lot of attention to africa in his speech but i have to say that i am nonetheless disappointed when i study the work programme for 
i cannot find any reference to africa in the introduction nor in the programme itself and i do hope therefore that mr prodi will produce a proper file by way of preparation of the summit in africa 
madam president words are essential but we can only judge the commission on its merits 
madam president mr president of the commission ladies and gentlemen i am not sure which to go by the strategic objectives for to or your speech for to 
have you already included your second term of office 
but seriously 
as it enlarges the union needs to be strengthened through streamlining and demarcation 
first streamlining 
what you say in your programme about concentrating on the core functions of the commission is only the beginning 
the activities of the entire union must be reduced to core areas of policy 
in other words a social ecologically-orientated market a secure currency guaranteed civil rights internally and representation of common interests externally 
it is not just that we need to speak out in the world with one voice it is what we want to say with this voice that it is important 
secondly the new in word is flexibility 
however increasing flexibility can or quickly threatens to turn into intergovernmentalisation 
we must hold fast to joint decision-making institutions which embrace the member states 
that also applies to the inclusion of the civil society which is a welcome step 
our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers 
transparency does not mean more access to more paper to our citizens transparency means greater clarity at long last as to who takes decisions in brussels and strasbourg when and with what right 
that is transparency 
thirdly the european union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly 
its borders are set not by how may countries want to join but by how many countries it can accommodate 
if the price of enlargement is the watering-down or even the break-up of the present union then it must not be paid 
it is too high a price not only for the member states already in the union but also for the states which want to join the union 
there is no future for a union which is merely a geo-strategic concept or for a union which is merely a free trade zone 
but the union will only continue to be more than a market and to be accredited by the people of europe if it sees itself as a community of destinies 
that goes far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new better quality of life 
not only the commission not only the european parliament but also the people and the states in our european union will have to find new answers to the question of how and why we want to live and work together 
in doing so we need no less to reinvent the european union but without destroying the present union 
madam president in the opinion of the group of the european liberal democrat and reform party the most important task of the commission and the whole union in the coming years is the successful realisation of enlargement 
the commission must carry on negotiations that are a decisive attempt to have each applicant country join the union as soon as possible 
on the other hand we have to see to it that none of the achievements or aims of integration that have been stated thus far are watered down 
to avoid this the european liberal democrats have expressed the hope that the intergovernmental conference will consider the various models of differentiated integration and create a concentric union in which there is a federal core and a less integrated outer ring 
it is clear that the subject of the internal differentiation of the union will be raised at the igc 
the subject needs to be discussed without prejudice 
a technical improvement in the flexibility system will not be enough we also have to raise the issue of developing our institutions for the countries in the vanguard as proposed by jacques delors for example 
in this way a decision-making system can be created that is more effective clearer more open and more democratic 
i hope that the commission will make its own proposal concerning how the expanding union might implement its institutional and other differentiation 
madam president mr president of the commission commissioners your inspiring speech mr prodi has quite won me over 
it raises expectations but it can also lead to disappointment 
this is connected to what mr van velzen was just saying about the difference between words and deeds 
the enlargement of the union is inspired by our wish for peace security and stability 
you are looking to reassure the acceding countries as well as european opinion 
but these days we are witnessing the exact reverse before our very eyes 
we have noted increasing levels of apprehension and disquiet even within regions where unemployment is quite low and prosperity very high 
we need to make our citizens feel at home according to mr swoboda and i agree 
this is a place where we share the same values and where each and one of us also have our own task and responsibility 
this is probably linked to the standards mentioned by mr van dam namely subsidiarity 
it is necessary to have a clear division of responsibility among all levels of authority and to be partners rather than competitors when it comes to policy 
it is also necessary to exercise authority as closely as possible to the citizens where it can be exercised with due transparency and can be monitored by the citizens themselves 
that will require a new political culture not only in words but also in practice which will take into consideration the reality of member states and regions 
regions which culturally and economically sometimes match the interest of some member states 
the new europe should not only expand horizontally but also vertically by living by our values in practice and by developing a democratic structure of a real community 
this is what the commission will be judged on 
madam president the commission is today presenting its strategic objectives for 
these are contained in an extremely general document in which all the problems have been glossed over to prevent any conflict 
yet these are the main themes in any discussion of strong european institutions in which only day-to-day tasks of execution are decentralised and a collective vision is promoted within an indistinct whole 
these ambiguities mask many misunderstandings primarily about our values 
it is not enough to claim to adhere to democracy in order to be a democrat 
it must clearly be accepted that the people should be free to make their decisions at the level which best combines the objective conditions of an immediate fair and transparent democratic debate namely at national level in the main 
yet the whole of the commission communication is based on the opposite theory 
in this theory on the pretext of ensuring the best protection for peoples their margin of independent choice should be increasingly limited by new regulations new policies or new restrictive legal structures such as the draft charter of fundamental rights 
this charter is really misnamed because it will actually reduce these rights 
in the union for a europe of nations group our principles are rather different 
clearly we want to defend the countries of europe but we also want to respect the autonomy of nations 
this is not impossible 
we must move away from the outmoded federalist schemes promoted by those whose every idea on european matters comes from the memoires of jean monnet 
instead we must open the european institutions to the modern world by creating a flexible dynamic which respects nations 
this is the keynote idea on the new governance which we would have liked to have seen in your communication mr prodi but which is unfortunately not there 
madam president mr prodi you claim to be shaping a new europe yet you are lacking one basic element confidence 
the confidence of millions of europeans cannot be won without being worthy of this 
and how could you be worthy of this after the mad cow scandal and the resignation of the santer commission for corruption 
you are responsible for millions of unemployed and for millions living in poverty insecurity and increasing misery because of your ultra-trade-oriented and ultra-liberal policies and because of the forced march towards the single currency 
you wanted and have obtained the abolition of internal borders 
consequently you have opened europe up to an explosion in crime and insecurity and to a flood of uncontrolled immigration 
you are now proposing to give all decision-making power to a handful of officials 
the member states local authorities and ngos will simply become enforcers of decisions handed down from above all on an equal footing in their submission to brussels 
not once does your twelve-page document mention the national parliaments even though they comprise the elected representatives of the people 
clearly they have no role to play in your strategy 
having tried for many years to persuade us by talking of shared sovereignty you are now revealing your ultimate goal 
you intend to trade in all european sovereignty whether national or collective for a world government in which you do not even expect to obtain a dominant position 
finally you are daring to condemn and penalise the free and democratic vote of millions of austrians or are allowing this to happen just because the result does not suit you 
yet at the same time you are supporting communist china and trading with countries which have openly violated human rights for decades 
members of this house are today speaking out against a telegram from mr prodi to chancellor schüssel which quite obviously is not a demonstration of sympathy but rather a political manoeuvre 
your sabre-rattling fools no one because as you know perfectly well whether you like it or not you need austria in order to reform the treaties and harmonise savings tax 
you will cynically and hypocritically use austria as a convenient threat to further strip the member states of any real powers in the construction of the european union 
your commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this 
the governments which through spinelessness or ideology support you are also responsible 
brussels is not all of us as you claim 
it is all of you 
tell the truth for once 
you could not care less what the people of europe want 
they are free to choose only between your brave new world and denouncement 
it is over ten years since the collapse of the soviet union and yet your projects contain a strong hint of the gulags and mollifying moralism 
we were among the small number who denounced the communist dictatorship 
we are and will remain among those fighting against europeanist dictatorship 
we call on all the people of europe to resist your monstrous projects 
the salvation of european democracies is with nation states 
it is a programme based on real-life situations and issues and it is therefore right to put concrete measures aside for the moment and focus on the major issues 
in my view mr prodi judging from the text and the document that you had sent to us one subject that is very important to both of us has been given secondary importance and that is solidarity not so much at international level as at internal level 
the archbishop of milan monsignor carlo maria martini is calling upon all politicians in particular those like you and me president prodi for whom the cultural and historic principle behind their presence in politics is the principle of the active involvement of catholics in politics to reconsider a development process which in addition to economic profit takes the marginalised and those left behind by society very much into account 
it is of the utmost importance to address the issue of those who cannot keep up one which reminds us of how difficult and complicated it is to establish progress indicators and how inadequate it is to use the parameter of per capita income alone 
it also reminds us of the need for a new growth model one that is firmly rooted in the culture of the catholics who are involved in social problems who see in the civil community and the social interaction that that must be encouraged and facilitated among the public the most natural instruments for building solidarity 
the fundamental element for the development of each person his freedom which comes before economic gain is thus enhanced 
this social freedom which becomes manifest in initiatives favouring the poor gives excellent results in terms of social justice and stability 
mr president public institutions must not accept only the economic criterion 
they must focus on service to people and commitment to achieving freedom for each individual without forgetting naturally that all this cannot and must not conflict with the need to create business to invest and risk and in an ordered and focused system entrepreneurs are able to make a substantial contribution to social growth solidarity 
our heritage has taught us that politics must have a heart 
we hope that the white paper and the actions of you and your commission will put this into practice 
our ambitions and our work will be followed not only by people in our own countries but also by many people outside europe and the european union 
what sort of impression will an interested public as well as the rest of the world have of this five-year programme 
my reply would be a new start a clear agenda for reform which confirms that the union in the will not stop at being an economic community but will become a community that can be trusted and that we take seriously 
the commission is correct in stating that the union intends to develop and safeguard the welfare state in an age of globalisation 
it foresees a just and more effective europe that also recognises its responsibilities beyond its own borders out of solidarity and enlightened self-interest 
consequently we see poverty and exclusion as the greatest enemies of peace and freedom 
i concur with what other members of my political group have said and i commend the tone of your document 
however there are two omissions which need to be addressed in our future work 
the first concerns women gender and women's rights 
you talked about how women can help in increasing production and growth 
that is important but equality is not only necessary for productivity but also to make our societies more democratic 
is that because mainstreaming is already so widespread in the commission that there is no need to mention women 
what other explanation could there be for omitting women 
the eu must not take on a masculine persona 
africa has the largest number of refugees in the world the most overall poverty and a debilitating aids epidemic 
i know that commissioner nielson and some of the other commissioners are doing a fine job but the rest of the commission also needs to focus more clearly on that continent partly by including it among its strategic goals 
finally i welcome the commission's statement and the fact that this says for the first time that the eu is prepared unilaterally to introduce measures to make it easier for developing countries to gain access to our markets 
i would merely ask when this is likely to take effect 
madam president president of the commission this is a vital document for the future and fate of europe 
however out of all the points two specifically require our attention and they are closely linked peace and stability within europe and outside europe 
it is a question of objectives that must be pursued as a priority 
for some time we have all agreed on this notion but we must also clearly affirm that these objectives will not be achieved without enlargement even if this comes at a price 
today we have been called on to choose for the forthcoming decades between a europe that might be less prosperous but a beacon of peace and civilisation for the whole planet and a europe that might be more wealthy but where there is uncertainty over what the future might bring 
the first supporter of this reform should be parliament itself if it really wants to increase its role of interpreting the will of the europeans and acquire the centrality which is part of a genuinely democratic and firmly integrated union 
moreover it will only be possible to give the commission responsibility for the tasks it takes on according to the actual powers it will be accorded 
without these prospects that we have outlined europe would once again have no future 
madam president mr prodi we are pleased about the overall intention of the objectives announced which are in line with the challenges which europe must overcome 
i note that you consider the fall of the berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century 
this event must underpin enlargement 
your idea is to concentrate your activities on the core tasks 
this is one of the goals of your reform 
in essence this means applying the principle of subsidiarity 
precise application of this principle can only reinforce the actions taken and give our citizens a clear view of each level of competence 
however saying is one thing and doing is another 
you must therefore fight against the tendency of all institutions to try and increase their powers 
i will therefore judge you on your deeds 
in the meantime i approve and encourage this clearly expressed desire in your communication 
however i must make two essential points 
these concern the simplification and application of community law 
in referrals were made to the court of justice for non-application or non-transposition and % of environmental directives were not applied or transposed 
recent events have shown us that these regulations are essential 
community law must not go unapplied because it is too complex or too pedantic 
the union must not make this mistake and i therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this 
you are being realistic when you say that the welfare state can no longer provide adequate responses to the problems facing us including unemployment 
nevertheless i regret that a clear alternative has not been proposed 
the emphasis should have been placed on the rejection of any policy of handouts and instead on the development of initiative and responsibility 
you have not highlighted the ageing of our population which will fundamentally alter the structure of our society not only economically but also in terms of public health 
this is a silent revolution and in this respect i expected more from your communication 
finally you do highlight european research as being at the heart of our future 
yet you do not indicate the resources you intend to implement to achieve this 
also ethical principles are at the heart of this research but your communication says nothing about these 
if you want to better inform the people you should start by strengthening liaison with this house as we are the representatives of the citizens 
madam president we can only endorse the general guidelines of the five-year programme and of the programme for set out with so much enthusiasm by president prodi this morning 
in the two documents strong emphasis is placed on the need to define new forms of european governance and to this end to introduce a new agenda for the commission establishing more stringent priorities in the pursuit of the goal of full employment through more efficient coordination of the economic and social policies of the states and primarily allow me to stress this of the nations that have joined the monetary union and which must be enabled to become the first example of closer cooperation 
firstly the promotion of and participation in the drafting of joint plans for the creation of an integrated services network in the transport and energy sectors with the backing of the european investment bank 
secondly the approval of investments where the parameters are binding when drawing up action programmes on employment to be made in individual countries via community projects in the priority sectors of research innovation and training 
i feel that these parameters particularly those of a qualitative nature resulting from investments in continuous training refresher courses adaptability and retraining of older workers are considerably more significant and binding owing to their lasting effects over the medium term than the simple drawing up of annual quantitative objectives that are always debatable regarding new employment or employment cuts 
if among other things as the programme of the portuguese presidency stresses as well the commission could promote a new phase of social dialogue focusing on an agreed strategy of socialisation and diffusion of knowledge in other words a strategy for employability and the definition of its rules this would allow us to take a step towards having employees participate in the informed and consensual management of the restructuring and reemployment processes 
thirdly i do not think that the decrease in the number of the working population owing to the ageing of the population is unavoidable and inevitable for the european union 
madam president mr president of the commission you have come here today mr prodi in a very reformist and ambitious mood 
i welcome you and your ambition 
ambition will be needed given the mammoth task which awaits us 
in order to make these reforms however and in order to make progress with the legislative programme we must be very sure not only of the strengths of the reformer himself but also of the opinions of others 
you say that you will not hesitate to come to this house to request more resources for the commission but the commission must be aware that we are walking on thin financial ice 
not a euro more or a euro less 
it will not be us who refuse these new resources 
you should ask the council 
these financial perspectives are adjusted to within a millimetre 
in order to finance the stability plan for the balkans we will have to negotiate a significant revision of category and you must remember the enormous difficulties we have had in approving the budget 
i would remind you that this group the ppe-de does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones 
the political priorities must be set by this house and the meps 
do not believe for one moment that your proposed reform of the budget will disguise the limitations of the community financial system 
it is all very well for us by mutual consensus to make an effort in terms of budgetary rationalisation but you must be very aware that the lack of resources the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget continue to be urgent issues which must be resolved 
we therefore wonder whether the commission has the political will to resolve them 
madam president the commission communication is well written but sufficiently vague to allow any interpretation whatsoever 
on one hand there are the words and on the other their real political meaning 
we socialists applaud the commission for wanting to fight against social exclusion and poverty 
yet how can the gulf between political rhetoric and reality be filled 
does this mean more flexibility insecurity and fixed-term contracts 
everyone knows that quality of life and full and better employment depend on sustainable economic growth 
the union is currently restricted to a policy of stability which is certainly necessary but insufficient 
we socialists desperately want a european pact for growth and employment 
the ingredients of this policy are well known 
they are the stimulation of public and private investment increased investment in research education and training and the promotion of the spirit of enterprise 
in this respect the e-europe initiative is to be welcomed 
in the world of new technologies the main danger remains that access to information will be easier the richer you are 
the gulfs which are opening up everywhere are the main problem for our era 
on one hand we have the exuberance of the financial markets and the explosion of wealth and on the other more widespread exclusion 
we are asking workers to be flexible innovative and ever more productive yet the fruits of this productivity increasingly benefit the shareholders alone 
the european central bank is keeping very quiet about the staggering rates of return on financial assets yet it never misses an opportunity to remind us that any wage increase should remain below the rate of increase in productivity 
how do we explain to workers who fall victim to the rationalisations of the worldwide monopoly game that they must be prepared to change career several times in their working lives when the captains of industry having lost the gamble of a take-over leave with compensation of eur million 
for years we have been told over and over that the economy must be liberalised 
the sectors which have been liberalised are experiencing an avalanche of mergers and acquisitions leading inevitably to monopoly situations 
all these stock market battles are based solely on forecast increases in profit of % % or % which are unrealistic in the long term 
the unfettered rise in prices of financial assets and property means that the risks are on the increase 
the main danger awaiting us in the medium term is not inflation but deflation caused by the collapse of the speculative bubbles on the international financial markets 
to conclude the next five years will be crucial 
we need new rules to regulate globalisation and we need investment in the real economy and in people 
we need the member states and the commission to ensure the social dimension of the market economy in a visible manner 
madam president mr president of the commission commissioners in my view this strategy paper has two clear weaknesses 
there is no point in drawing up a new economic and social agenda if you have not even finished the old one 
i am thinking of transport policy and regional policy 
you have excellent commissioners for both issues in mrs palacio and mr barnier yet still you attach too little importance to these areas 
and do you know why 
just look at transport policy clearly it is crucial for this policy to be drawn up as a economically and ecologically sensible policy before the accession of other countries 
i would be grateful if the president of the commission would listen to what i have to say although of course he has no obligation to do so 
let me give you three examples 
first we need reasonable deregulation of the railway sector because we want to shift freight from the roads to the railways 
that makes sense from an economic and an ecological point of view 
without deregulation we will not make any headway with a reasonable transport policy 
the same applies to european air traffic control 
our citizens cannot understand that we are deregulating air traffic but leaving different sectors in the skies which are under national control which have an adverse economic impact on the airlines and which pollute the environment 
you still have not finished that agenda 
commissioner far too little is said in your paper about regional policy 
economic and social cohesion in the eu is a fundamental task of this community 
if we fail to complete it citizens in less favoured regions will dread enlargement 
we must show them that we intend to use the next five years to help them join the rich regions by promoting the less favoured regions using reasonable means 
then they too will be prepared to really support enlargement and help to achieve it 
mr president of the commission if we do not manage to create true solidarity between the rich and the poor regions then this union will be all the poorer and it will not meet with the approval of the people 
madam president mr president of the commission commissioners the fact that we are formulating new programmes does not mean that we should neglect those older programmes which are at implementation stage 
i hope this reference means that the reorganisation of the commission currently in progress will not damage the mechanism for monitoring and implementing agenda 
the agenda issues are of course ones that relate to your third and fourth strategic objectives the economic and social agenda and a better quality of life 
what your texts do not make apparent is the extent to which these major high-minded objectives are compatible with the resources that the commission intends to deploy 
i do not necessarily mean financial resources 
the implementation of agenda in the agricultural sector does not ultimately require more money 
there must also be savings 
but what we need is the analytical resources these issues require the investment of more intellectual capital 
this is because it is essential to achieve two things the european model of multifunctionality in agriculture must be secured and this must be done in a way which facilitates the liberalisation of world trade in agricultural products mainly to the benefit of developing countries 
it is not easy to combine those aims 
there is no obvious way 
there may well be contradictions between the two objectives and there is nothing to show that the commission has pointed out those contradictions and how it proposes to deal with them 
as regards the other aspect of agenda the aspect of cohesion and regional development there we do indeed have great achievements to point to but there are still less developed regions particularly island regions to which more attention should be paid 
as for fishing there is nothing in your programme to tell us that the predatory exploitation of fishing grounds which has gone as far as to wipe out entire species of fish will certainly prove fruitful in the future 
perhaps these issues should be approached with greater attention and a greater esprit de finesse 
madam president i want to start by reinforcing the caution that has been expressed by many colleagues here in addressing this five-year plan 
in setting very ambitious long-term goals we must not take our eyes away from the present 
that was a point made very forcibly by the leader of my group mr poettering in his opening address 
the union must not take on a whole range of new tasks without the basic foundation for a successful european economy being in place 
that foundation is clearly the single market 
how strongly is the single market established at the moment 
nearly % of businesses in this survey are still reporting additional costs to render products or services compatible with national specifications 
these are the classic symptoms of continued obstruction by national governments bureaucratic red-tape blocking market entry 
we have to keep the pressure up in all areas by removing further barriers intensifying pressure on member states who fail to implement single market measures and of course extending into crucial new areas like financial services 
only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieved 
an enlarged europe must build on the existing strengths of the union 
the single market extending across that enlarged union is going to be a colossal achievement 
i conclude by saying on behalf of all my conservative colleagues and we are the second largest national delegation in this parliament that we pledge our full support to the commission and to mr prodi in achieving this historic task 
madam president mr prodi ladies and gentlemen at the time of our vote on your appointment we invited you to come here today 
the serious business is therefore now going to start as we are to vote on your programme 
from your speech i will concentrate on what you have called the new governance which you will use as a tool for reconciliation with our fellow citizens 
yet this new governance simply means how the institutions and our public authorities operate if we agree that the european union must be a public authority 
the interlinking of the eu institutions the responsibilities of the member states and the local and regional authorities is all very well 
yet is this really how we will reconcile the people and european construction 
it is these questions which cause concern among our fellow citizens 
in your speech you mentioned the challenges of globalisation and enlargement which await us 
i would add to these the future of our social model 
this is why i and my group are so firmly insisting on the charter of fundamental rights 
the reason our timetable includes the drafting of this charter is because we are at a key point in our history 
our union needs to redefine the values on which it is based both within its current borders and also with a view to the imminent enlargements which we earnestly desire but not under just any conditions 
our people expect more europe but not just any europe 
they are expecting us not to fall in with globalisation but rather on the basis of our social model to be able to organise globalisation 
in this respect i must say that in terms of your commitment to a political union to which we are favourable this cannot be achieved unless it is based on our social model on our originality and our capacity to better regulate the business of this world 
madam president mr president of the commission commissioners i should like to start with a quote the commission will continue to work towards establishing a european charter of fundamental rights and draw up proposals to bring about an ambitious programme 
the commission is planning in particular to develop a genuine european policy on asylum and immigration 
it wishes to boost judicial assistance and cooperation and to develop an effective approach to the fight against all forms of crime 
that is the entire programme for the next five years on the question of internal security freedom citizens' rights and judicial cooperation 
a paper this short is a farce 
a farce because we know and appreciate the work of commissioner vitorino and what we have here on paper is a blatant contradiction to how things actually stand 
a paper such as this is no basis for a scoreboard 
it has been extolled and celebrated as a huge achievement and i am all for it we need a basis for a scoreboard 
we here in parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme 
what we are looking for are minimum standards in asylum procedures so that refugees can be given help quickly and those who are not fleeing know where they stand 
we want instruments to prevent abuse 
we want to develop a community immigration policy which takes account of the member states' capacity to absorb immigrants and we need to extend the operational powers of europol for example so that specific steps can be taken to combat organised crime 
we debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the commission even where it is merely submitting a paper 
madam president mr president of the commission commissioners i rise to speak on the subject of the world trade organisation on which there is a broad convergence of views between the commission documents and the positions of the socialist group 
this is not the case in other areas as has already been pointed out 
we share these views because we are in favour of world trade but we want this trade to be conducted according to common standards common rules which would regulate world trade with one aim in mind 
on the other hand what does this statement tell us about principles 
it is therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves what purpose do the current common standards and rules serve 
what good are the current way in which we negotiate and the way in which the world trade organisation works if they cause trade to increase on the one hand but on the other they create problems and above all cause this gulf between rich and poor countries to grow 
that is why we said that we were in favour of the strategy that the commission outlined here for the seattle negotiations and for later ones 
we are certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious 
we need to be demanding and ensure that social rights environmental rights and consumer protection are incorporated into the forthcoming negotiations 
most importantly though we must have a brave and ambitious long-term vision for reform not just of the wto but also of the ilo the united nations and above all of the financial institutions specifically the imf and the world bank 
we must be brave and not only see some aspects of globalisation 
we must be brave enough to have more of an overview of this process so that wealth does not only benefit the most highly-developed blocks and countries but that there is also harmonious change and development in every region in the world 
having said this madam president i am prepared once again to be a voice crying in the wilderness as a result of the absence of a fishing policy 
it is really surprising that the commission does not treat the revision of one of its common policies as a strategic objective for the coming years in view of the reform which must take place in 
there is no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many years 
however it seems that the commission does not share this view although it is the commission which is obliged to present the council and parliament with a report on the functioning of the common fisheries policy over the last decade before the end of and it is on this basis that the council will have to make the appropriate decisions with regard to its modification 
in fact the revision process has already begun for many bodies and institutions such as the european parliament which in already issued and adopted a report pointing out all the current problems and deficiencies of the common fisheries policy 
we have often asked for a basic timetable for this revision and we have received no reply 
less than two years is not much time if we bear in mind also that the fishing policy is anomalous with regard to the internal market regulations and that such anomalies should be resolved within the framework of this reform process 
therefore madam president mr president of the commission i would ask that this issue which is of vital importance to a very significant industry within the european union be taken into account in this strategy and these strategic objectives for the next five years 
madam president i should like to add my congratulations to commissioner prodi's programme 
i particularly welcome his recognition of this virtuous circle of having sustained growth the information society in an expanding european market with the addition of a fully functioning single currency which will give us the opportunity to genuinely promote prosperity innovation enterprise the entrepreneurial spirit and yes most importantly of all extra-high value sustainable jobs for our european citizens 
i have one observation not a criticism to make regarding commissioner prodi's statement this morning and that is that it was a little weak on the actual content of economic policy 
we must not take anything for granted in terms of how we get the european economy restructured 
after all what is social justice if it is without full employment 
full employment is the best way to generate social justice for our citizens 
this is a key priority for us to focus on 
i should like to welcome one or two initiatives that have already come from the commission which will help us in particular commissioner liikanen's commitment to having an innovative knowledge-driven economy 
yes e-europe will be the future for us because it will help us create new prosperity and new jobs 
i welcome the commission initiatives now and in the past to support our small and medium-sized enterprises and i would like to congratulate our portuguese presidency for its initiative on having a charter for micro-businesses 
that is important and something that can be developed through the lisbon summit 
i also welcome commissioner busquin's idea to have a common research area for the whole of the european union 
again this is a way that we can help create better opportunities for jobs and for prosperity 
you said in your summary commissioner prodi that liberalisation competitiveness keeping inflation low innovation science and technology are central for the future success of the european economy and creating jobs 
i very much agree with you on that but we can take nothing for granted 
there is still more we have to do and the lisbon summit will become part of that 
so with those remarks i would like to congratulate you on the programme and wish it every success 
madam president mr president of the commission i should like to focus on two points which are not mentioned in your programme 
to me this commission strategy paper for the next five years reads like a scientific paper on the european union or a declaration of principle 
unfortunately it does not give the impression of being a real political strategy on the part of the commission 
as the spokesperson for cultural and training policy for my group i would have expected more in the way of agenda from an italian president of the commission 
the commission gives no soul to europe 
culture and training simply do not exist in this paper despite the fact that we need to create a real area of training and culture in europe 
just a few main points 
i am talking about the integration of the policies of the culture industry in this area of training and culture they create jobs 
i am talking about the introduction of cultural mainstreaming in all policy areas about consolidating and improving the european dimension of training and education syllabuses and about networking training and education policies in europe especially lifelong learning 
mr president of the commission it is the new millennium and you made no mention whatsoever of the audio-visual area of europe 
nor was any mention made of information policy and communications catering to the needs of our citizens 
it seems to me that something is missing from this programme 
truly european citizenship depends on our creating a real visible area of training and culture 
declarations of principle are not enough 
we need an agenda which can be translated into political action by the commission on an ongoing basis in the way in which i have just described 
madam president mr prodi how would you take stock of your policy and work programme what would your benchmark be if you had to make direct choices 
you have the fine charming idea that the outcome and the benchmark for your policy and for your five-year programme will be the result of the elections or rather the turnout at the next european elections 
when i think that i have to explain your work programme week in week out to my constituents not in the rarefied atmosphere of this house but on the street then i ask myself what can i say 
mr prodi what can i say what is there that is new 
there is nothing new in your work programme 
does that give me hope for the year 
no it does not 
in your work programme for you state something quite clever 
you say that environmental considerations must be integrated into all other policy areas 
have you done so mr prodi have you even read your work programme for the year 
no you have not done so 
you have not integrated environmental policy into enlargement despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problems of enlargement 
nor have you integrated it into economic policy competition or the internal market 
you have not integrated it anywhere 
you have tacked a few components together but you have no overall structure 
you said earlier in your speech that a disaster such as that of the danube is an example of the need for an emergency structure no mr prodi we need at long last to start transposing legislation and ensuring that legislation is monitored 
you say in your five-year programme that the people of the european union rightly expect food standards to be higher and better foodstuffs legislation 
mr prodi you do not know what you are talking about 
the foodstuffs legislation in the european union is the most ambitious in the world 
where it falls short what is missing is transposition in the member states and monitoring 
it is time you took your job seriously it is time for you as president of the commission to box the member states on the ears and force them to do their work and fulfil their duties 
that is what we expect of you in the next five years
